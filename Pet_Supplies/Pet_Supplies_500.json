I have two dogs and the second one started this habit and taught it to our first dog.  So disgusting!  As suggested by others we doubled the dosage and so far (about six months plus) it's been working I would say about 90% of the time (that we can tell).My husband and I work long hours so they are in our side yard (about 15 x 45) for many hours by themselves with a door to the garage.  Though we walk them in the morning and then check the side yard for any deposits before we leave for work, before using this product, it was not uncommon for us to come home to dogs with horrible breath and a side yard of half-eaten piles.  We also had a dog walker come 2-3 times a week in the middle of the day to walk them again (and pick up any piles) to alleviate this problem.  However, we still ecountered this problem rather frequently.  The poor dogs really suffered for it too because we didn't want them anywhere near us at night because they smelled so disgusting.With this product, we believe that the habit has stopped, if not all the way, at least to a significant degree.  Other than I think twice in the last six months, we now come home to dogs that don't gross us out with their bad breath anymore.  And everyone is much happier for it.One more thing:  Our first dog was starting to get finicky with his food.  I don't know if this powder was to blame or if it's a supplement that we also give to him.  But what I found out works really well are those liver biscotti sprinkles.  Just adding a bit of those to the top of his dry dog food really helps with his finishing his food.

She'd been living in multi-dog households (meaning four dogs or more) for her entire life. We just have one other dog, her brother. She immediately began ingesting feces from both her and her brother. I'm not sure if this is a habit from living with many other dogs or was brought on by the stress of being in a new home, but I was determined to stop it.We tried a product from Drs. Foster and Smith called Distaste and it worked quite well, but my male dog wasn't terribly thrilled with it-- it came in chew form and he didn't seem to like them. So I found this SEP and was glad to see it's something mixed into their food. It does not work as well as the Distaste, but seems to discourage her. All winter I have noticed my female picking up frozen specimens and marching around the yard with them... but she doesn't seem to be eating them. I plan to double the dose, as some other reviewers have noted, and we'll see how things go through the spring. We are typically quick about cleaning up after them, particularly now that we can see the ground, but occasionally we miss a pile. I'm hoping that the problems we had this winter with the SEP not working well were maybe because the feces were frozen, and now that things are thawing, maybe the SEP will discourage her more strongly.So bottom line, it seems to be working fairly well, but has not broken the habit completely. My only other comment is the smell of the product itself. It smells like Pixie Stick dust, or something similarly sweet/sour and I find the smell really awful.

I bought it at Lowe's for about the same price on Amazon a few weeks ago.  A couple problems: the hook at the top slides around the short section of wire on the cage that it hooks on (maybe an inch total).  Just means that it doesn't sit perfectly level.  The problem with that is that the birds don't like sitting on the downward-sloping part, so they only use the upward sloping part.  I'm going to try modding it so the hook isn't detachable and doesn't slide, but just stays in the middle so it's level.  The other issue is that the birds don't like sitting on the front/back of the suet cage, I think because it moves around a lot when they land, but every time they try it, there's a lot of wing flapping for a few seconds before they give up and use the other feeder.  This might get better with time.  If it does, I will update this review.  For now, I would say it's so-so for a suet feeder.  I've been looking at nicer more expensive ones, but I'll give this another month (and update this review!)UPDATE: The feeder made it through the season, but I don't think I'd buy again.  Not even sure if I'll put it out next year.  I have another feeder that has space for suet on each side.  That suet gets eaten REALLY quickly, while the one in the cage lasts long enough to start molding (several weeks).

When I'm cleaning it they pace around me like a child waiting for their teddy bear to come out of the wash. When I had one cat the bin needed to be emptied once a week. Now with 2 it's more like every 3 days. I line the bin with a little trash bag and it works great. No need to buy the expensive receptacles. Every so often I'll have to use the special litter scoop that comes with it to scrape some \"left over\" off the rake. It does make a noise but it's not that loud. I recommend leaving it in a closet or laundry room. Guests always ask why my boiler room is making noise. The noise doesn't bother my cats, they actually come running to watch it work. It is, however, the only litter box they've ever known.The Catch: I bought the box in April and had no problems until late October when I realized the box was getting very full. The censors had stopped working. I called their customer service, who's pre-recorded message makes you think you've called the wrong number (they start talking about tools), and spoke with some friendly but not 100% knowledgeable people. They gave me all kinds of instructions on how to fix it myself like dusting off the censors, \"re-setting\" the box by clicking the switches 10 times each, etc. All of these things I tried as they are in the instructions but I humored them. Finally they gave me instructions on how to get a new box so now I'm in the process of mailing the wire that powers the rake, the battery compartment cover, my receipt, and $10 so I can get a new one. I'm not too happy that I had to destroy my box with no guarantee they will send me a new one but I understand why they make you do it.The Moral of the Story: Nothing makes a cat happier than a clean littler box and now that it's broken I simply can't keep it clean enough for them (in their opinions). I'm going to get the replacement and use it until it breaks too but I think I'm going to look into the toilet training kit.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Love - Hate relationship", "unixReviewTime": 1164067200, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2006"}
{"reviewerID": "A1QCJOGQL05KRI", "asin": "B00005MF9T", "reviewerName": "Jaw", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "I gave 5 stars because i've had three Litter Maids over about 12-13 years and have always been very grateful not to have to clean the catbox--i was able to forget about it for at least a couple of weeks at a time, sometimes much more. I have only one small cat.  You can't beat not having to think about the catbox, it's almost like not having one at all--compared to the old fashion litter box.I first saw the Litter Maid in the LA Times Magazine around 1995, there was a full page ad, and you could pay in three installments, it was expensive, at least a couple hundred.  Catbox scooping depressed me so i ordered one.  Mine worked right out of the box.it's always tricky putting the right amount of litter in.  If i put too much, it just keeps recycling and raking until i take some out.  Following the instructions, i found that there would be too much litter and the machine would malfunction, but if i put it lower than the limit line, it would be fine.I had some kind of technical problem in the beginning, i can't remember what, and was pleased with their tech support, they took care of me, way back then.After a few years, it stopped working and i gladly got another one.  At some point, i began using Litter Pearls cat litter in it when that first came out.  That was yet another technical advance for my situation.  The Litter Pearls absorbed the urine so there was less stuff getting scooped into the box, and i was able to go even longer without being reminded of the litter box.In the beginning, Litter Pearls was just regular little round pearls. Then, my pet store came out with \"lite tracking litter pearls\" which were not round. They made them irregular shaped and rough, to prevent tracking i guess. That new light tracking style did not agree with my Litter Maid.  It was too granular and it jammed up the mechanism.  My pet store stopped carrying the regular non-lite tracking kind of Litter Pearls, so i had to search for an alternative.The combination of those little round litter balls and the Litter Maid did great things for my quality of life.  I did not want to go backwards into using the old fashioned kind of litter. I was ready to buy the regular Litter Pearls from the company in another state, (i called around) if necessary, or on eBay, but i was able to find another brand that had the round balls in a local store, the brand is Litter Secret, i couldn't find the product on the web though.As long as i had the little round ball litter, not the lite tracking kind, my Litter Maid performed consistently.  The second one lasted several more years with never a mechanical problem.  Long ago, i got the tent. I would always use a tent with the Litter Maid.  For me, the less evidence of a litter box the better.The Litter Maid rake did not clean easily and with my policy of not paying a lot of attention to the litter box, eventually the second Litter Maid got messy and the price had come way down on them, so i decided rather than clean it, i'd just get a new one.  the motor was still working fine, there was no problem with it after several years. I just didn't feel like cleaning it, was working lots of overtime and my job and felt i could afford a new one. I've had the third one for several more years, it has been very low maintenance, no mechanical problems, i just have cleaned it every few weeks, i'm not sure how often, maybe 2 weeks, maybe more, it seems long between times when i have to deal with it.Recently it stopped working.  The light was on but without warning, it wouldn't become active, it just sat there.I got a Litter Robot to replace it, because of the great reviews and decided i would try a change, since LItter Robot will let you return it for 60 days.  I'm still evaluating the Litter Robot, but there are some things that so far, i like better about the Litter Maid, one is, i didnt' have to regularly clean the Litter Maid, just take out the plastic containers, and then do a big cleaning once in a great while.  I think i'm going to have to clean the Litter Robot more often.The Litter Maid plastic containers were easier for me to switch out and replace than the plastic bags for the Litter Robot, less struggle, less time spent bending over the \"dreaded area.\"  And more secure feeling because stiff plastic is thicker than a plastic bag.Being inside the tent, the LItter Maid didn't have anything directly exposed to open air, whereas the Robot sits there with its door open and litter sitting out there in contact with the rest of the world.  Having said all of that, the LItter Robot is very cool.  More ingenious than the LItter Maid.  anyone could dream up the LItter Maid.  It would take a special kind of mind to think up the Litter Robot.  Watching it do its thing is something to behold, in terms of human engineering.  I was very happy with the LItter Maid, my three worked reliably and flawlessly each one for many years.  I didn't have to deal with tech support.  But again, i had only one small cat.Oh, i almost forgot. My cat always liked to use only one side of the Litter Maid, so the waste would pile up on one end of the plastic container, causing it to fill up faster, only on that side, than it would if it had been distributed evenly.  When it fills up and doesn't close completely, that's when i can smell it and i go into action to change the container, but i alway would find that half the container wasn't used, it was empty on one side, full on the other. This never affected the mechanical performance of the Litter Maid itself.Update:  10/3/10I have just retired my most recent Litter Maid which i started using a year ago.  I was having a very hard time with it.  It worked well as far as the motor and everything it's supposed to do, but the problem  was with the litter (crystals). The crystals were getting saturated in only about 4 days and if i didn't change the litter, my cat would pee on the floor cover that i kept under the litter maid.  That is way too frequent to have to deal with cat sewage, by my standards.  Urine was getting all over the box and under the box. I thought the litter maid was leaking but couldn't find any openings.  It took me a long time to figure out that my cat's hyperthyroid condition was causing her to excessively urinate.  When i realized it, about two months ago, i doubled her medication and the problem has gone away. but she continued to refuse to use the Litter Maid, i think it must've developed an odor because of all the urine all over it, i tried to wipe it off but far from perfectly i'm sure.  Even though the crystals weren't saturated at all, she was peeing on the floor cover.  So i have just replaced the Litter Maid with a ScoopFree automatic box. So far it's working great. I took the Litter Maid outside, cleaned it as best i could with diluted Simple Green spray, it looks ok, i put it some big plastic bags and will keep it in the garage.  It has been working very well.  A real trooper.I want to say that i appreciate the Litter Maid, it served me well for about 16 or more years, about 5 of them over those years, two were thrown out not because they wore out but because they were dirty so in my experience they have worked well. I never had a problem with the motors, and i was always impressed at the way it just kept raking over and over, never giving out.This is different from some peoples' experience.  I want say that i have always used Litter Pearls crystals in the litter Maid, not clay or clumping litter, and that may be why i haven't had the same problems some have had.  I would recommend using crystal litter with it, but in my experience, it had to be the rounded kind, not the trackless/lite tracking kind which are irregularly shaped.  The trackless kind were too abrasive and jagged for the litter maid, they jammed it up, causing the rake to come to a painful creaking halt in mid cycle. But the rounded ones work well, they just aren't easy to find because people tend to prefer lite tracking litter.  But other than that, the crystals have always worked great in the Litter Maid.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "not perfect but i've loved them", "unixReviewTime": 1190419200, "reviewTime": "09 22, 2007"}

This LitterMaid LM500 Automated Litter Box was the first automated solution we tried.

I'll note that we didn't even try having this be the \"only\" litter box in our home! We had two others there too. We just wanted to see how well this worked. The storage container would get jammed in the open position, so that it did not do a good job of managing stench.However, we could have dealt with those issues. We could have cleaned the tines daily, and pushed down the lid ourselves regularly. The real problem was far more serious.First, understand how this works. The system sense motion and then X minutes after the cat has left the area, the tines move across, dragging any solids and clumps with it, pushing those items into the receptacle plastic box at the far end. Then the tines return to their original position and wait for a new visit.What happened with our unit would be that the tines would decide that they were ALWAYS ON and would keep going back and forth, back and forth, driving the poor kitties to distraction. There was no way they were going to jump in there and try to do their business while a set of metal tines was growling towards them!We tried several times to fix this, but it really just wasn't worth it.

I mean cleaning completely, with a new coat of scotch-guard on the pan surface and fresh litter refilled.And that may not make a difference if you have a cat that aims for the plastic tines. And cleaning those is kinda nasty. I've noticed that a new version is out with metal tines.  Maybe the manufacturer's cat had good aim too.Since writing the review below we got a cat with exceptional aim. He could jam up that thing in one session. We were cleaning it every day, and finally opted this year to get a plain old deep rectangular litter pan with scoopable litter and ditch the Litter Maid.  Heck - we were in cleaning it everyday anyway due to our 'artistic' new cat.---------------------------------------I have three cats, all indoor, and you can imagine I've tried about every kind of litter to come up with something workable for both me and the cats.I've had a LitterMate (the larger size) for almost a year now and think this is the next best thing to sliced bread. we liked it so well, we've recently gotten the regular sized one as well since the cats were giving the one we had such a workout.Pros:Our dogs no longer go litter-diving for 'snacks'. The mechanism scares them and most of the contents are now hidden away in the plastic container.The cats are only fascinated by the workings of the litterbox and had no problem adjusting. The oldest was 6, the youngest 5 months.Scoopable litter + three cats previously meant 2-3 times a day  scooping the litterbox. One LitterMate + three cats = 2-3 times a week tray dumping.  The trays are easily reused, making them more economical.The box itself has been dumped and cleaned every other month. The comb is held in place by two screws and is easily removed from the engine to be cleaned. I soak the bottom pan and comb in an antibacterial  cleaner solution, and after it's dry use Scotchguard on both.The house I live in is small - there are few places to hide litterbox odor. This does it effectively.One of our cats like to dig his way to China when he covers his stuff.  I was worried that the scratches on the bottom of the pan would cause more sticking than normal, but a generous coating of Scotchguard keeps things moving along in spite of the battle scars in the LitterMaid.Cons:Yes - litter does escape underneath a little, but with the activities of three cats we were always vaccuming around the litter box anyway - no difference there.The litter flinging problem happened once to me - every time afterwards I threw the garbage bag on top of the tray while I removed it, then just tipped it into the bag. Again, no biggie.Tips:Those lines in the litterbox aren't kidding - don't fill the box over the red line, or the motor will jam.When they say Premium clumping litter, they mean it.  The alternative is a constantly jammed motor.Whenever you empty the tray, pass the scraper through the pan to make sure that nothing escaped the comb along the bottom. Those spots can build up and cause a jam too.If stuff sticks too often to the comb or bottom, it usually means it's time to dumb the entire box and clean and re-coat it with nonsitck spray.

None really prevents it from performing its function (eventually) but all add up to a real pain. One problem is that the plastic boxes that the cat manure is scooped up into do not fit very well into their canister. As a result cat litter seeps through the gaps and you end up having to vacuum underneath every few days. It should not have been that difficult to make a better fitting plastic box or area where it is to be placed.A second problem is that the red \"fill\" line is misleading. If litter is filled up to that point (or even fairly close to it) the machine jams. As a result, to prevent jamming, one needs to fill the device with far below its full capacity. This, in turn, necessitates filling the machine with more cat litter than should be the case (i.e., twice a week instead of once).A third problem is that the rakes, many times, get jammed due to filling up with litter. The rakes should have been made further apart to reduce this.In short, the machine does do its job but with a few relatively minor modifications (that should have been easy to spot for the manufacturer) this machine could have been much improved._______________________________Update:After less than one year machine breaks down and needs to be replaced.

It took a few trials to find a litter that worked well but I settled on Scoop Away. Yes, as some reviewers have mentioned, sometimes it does stick to the bottom and you will have to use the scooper to scrape it up or clean the rakes sometimes. Then, I just turn it on and off and it will rake everything up.  It only takes me a few seconds to check for any stuck spots or even out the litter, turn it on and off to make it rake and then add a little new litter to the top (so the cats think it's nice and clean). :-) It's not completely \"no work\" but it is a lot less work than a \"manual\" litterbox and stays smelling cleaner than manual boxes.  I do use larger plastic grocery bags in the receptacle. It's a lot cheaper than throwing away receptacles every 3-4 days and it's alot easier to clean. Believe me, I do not like trying to pry those receptacles out when it is completely full.  You have to stick your fingers inside to grab onto it (YUCK!) and it's heavy and hard to get out sometimes dumping litter and stuff all over the place (double YUCK).The Seller on Ebay was selling the one I bought with a \"super charged\" motor (which is in the electrical cord). It worked pretty good for almost a year. Apparently, unlike the \"normal motor\", the stronger motor kept it from resetting sometimes when it would hit clumps that were too big for it.  It would attempt to plow right thru which sounds like a good thing, but it wasn't. Apparently the gears and/or sprokets which move the rake along are made of plastic and within a year they were stripped. It started out making a spinning sound once in awhile but would eventually go ahead and rake. One day I came home to a god awful sound. I found the rake stuck right in the middle of the box, gears just spinning and making a heck of a racket. This was enough to scare away ALL 4 cats from the ONLY litterbox. Needless to say we had some accidents. 3 of my cats \"recovered\" and would go back to the disconnected box, but my 20 year old cat was traumatized and refused to use it. So I had to set up the manual box. I'm STILL working with her trying to get her to stop going elsewhere because of this.I took the Littermaid to a repair shop and they knew immediately that the gears were stripped because they'd seen it before. They said they couldn't repair it because they couldn't get parts.I contacted the Ebay Seller who said it was still under warranty. I had to pay shipping to and from the Seller though which was not cheap. The 2nd supercharged Littermaid started doing the same thing after less than 6 months and the Seller says this one is not under warranty. Apparently, the warranty does not extend to the replacement that they sent me which I think is a rip-off considering how expensive these things are.While the 1st Littermaid was being repaired, I went ahead and bought another \"regular\" (not supercharged) Littermaid from Petsmart. I've had it 8 months and had no skipping problems so far. I think the \"supercharged\" motor caused all my problems, but KittenKaboodle refuses to acknowledge this and refused to warranty the 2nd box that they sent me.So, overall it's great when it works, but it could use a few improvements. The bottom of the pan needs to be made of something more \"non-stick\" so the rake can get thru some of the larger wet spots and/or the gears need to be made of something stronger to be able to take a stronger motor that can get thru the stuck on clumps (and not strip the gears). Also I would like to see a slightly larger receptacle on the larger models. They are made for a multi cat household but with only one litterbox it fills up pretty fast. With 2 litterboxes it's not too bad though. I would also like to see some sort of hood like other auto litterboxes that I've seen.

You may work around this requirement by using plain grocery bags to line the receptacles, but after a few weeks of use the receptacles break anyway.Third, the capacity is lacking; When I got my second cat I found out I had to empty out the machine practically every day. If I waited for the second day, the container would overfill, sometimes because all the clumps were on the same side, keeping the lid open (you can imagine the smell)Finally, my youngest cat has a very fragile stomach. Well let me tell you, the raking process is not designed to handle runny poo. This was the last drop in the bucket, which prompted me to do some research on the web. Six months ago, I bought the litter-robot (litter-robot dot com), and my two cats and I couldn't be more satisfied.In summary, the LitterMaid is great if you only have one cat who never gets the runs.

Try setting it up with the power off for a few days and then turn it on after the cat gets use to using the box. The only other issue is that there is a raking motion that pushes all the waste forward but it also pushes good litter with it so the end result is good litter gets dumped into the plastic bin.  I had the option of buying the newer unit but read so many bad reviews that I decided to go for one of the older models.  I also build a table with a hole in it.

A+++++I should tell you that I've had this litter box before..About 6 years ago I had 3 cats and bought one of these litter boxes to save my sanity and my back.

This litter is supposed to be better than the regular litter because it is more absorbent than the regular and it clumps and drys more quickly than the traditional kitty litter. Since the Littermaid Litter box rakes the litter 10 minutes after the cat leaves, you need a litter that can clump and dry quickly. Well, now I get this! Since I bought the litter box (2 weeks ago) I havent had any clogs and am actually using less Kitty litter than before since it clumps so well.The litterbox is turnkey provided you use the premium kitty litter. I am really glad I bought this product. I am happy...Oh, another point, MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE KITTY LITTER LEVEL BELOW THE SUGGESTED LINE.

It works as advertised and even though the replacement cartridges are expensive, they last a long time and actually cost us less than we were paying for litter alone.  We have now bought a second Scoop Free and find we only use three cartridges a month, and have never had to clean it except for waste that has gotten on the sides that needs to be wiped off, but we would have that problem no matter what type of box we used.If you are thinking about buying an automatic litter box I would suggest you buy the Scoop Free instead of this one.

I've always found them to be great, but not very long lived.My littermaids have serviced 2 cats at all times.  So, if you are a single cat house, you could reasonably expect 5-7 years of use from one of these.  The first unit's motor died.  The second, the spring in the power rake's cord broke, and couldn't reel in the cord anymore.  The third (my last) up and died, no warning or otherwise.  Just stopped running.My first Littermaid was the original.  It lasted about 4 years.  The next was the original \"Mega Advance\" and was the best when it was working.  That only lasted about 3-4 years.  The last Mega (not advance) lasted about 5-6 years, but was very noisy.This newer unit seems to be basically the same as the last Mega, but the motor is slightly more quiet and pushes the rake through the box at a faster clip.  Both nice improvements.  The included scoop has tines in it to clean out the rake, a great idea that only took 15 years....I've never run my Littermaids on batteries, always using the A/C plug.  If the power's out for a few hours, we can survive, or if needed, scoop.If there was a way to make the system a bit more quiet it would be perfect.Tips:1.  Don't over-fill the box.  Use the bottom (add litter) line as the top fill line.  If you fill to the top line, the system will not work as well.  This seems to be the #1 problem people have, adding too much litter.2.  Use a bit of cooking oil spray (Pam) on the bottom of the pan before you fill with litter.  I rarely clean ours, but when I do, I always spray the bottom of the pan and that really helps keep the box cleaner and helps keep the nasty stuff from getting stuck to the bottom.3.  Use high-quality clumping litter.  We get the big tub of Scoop-Away from Costco.  That lasts more than a month for us.4.  Re-use the waste containers.  They each should last a month or more. Just keep using them until they crack when you are removing to dump the contents.  Then replace.  Saves lots of money there.This would be a 5 star if it was just a bit more quiet overall.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Must have appliance for the lazy cat owner", "unixReviewTime": 1252540800, "reviewTime": "09 10, 2009"}

Must've been around 1994 or 95.  Not too long after that, i got the tent.  I went through about 3 or 4 Litter Maids in that time, the motors kept working but they got too dirty and it was time for a fresh one, was my thinking.  That one tent outlived all those litter Boxes.  For me, the tent was great, I liked that it was light weight. It wasn't too flimsy, i could always easily unzip it and zip it back.  Sorry to hear the new ones are poorer quality, i hate when that happens. I have ordered one because i am about to start using a Litter Maid again after a couple of years with a Litter Robot, and when i took the tent apart last time, when i got rid of the last Litter Maid, one piece of the frame wouldn't go back on, i don't know why. But i have to say that overall, that one tent i had certainly held up well. My cat is not rough on things so that may be part of my success with this item on my first experience.  At that time, i had recently moved into an apartment that didn't allow pets, but we already had the cat before we moved in so since she is small, quiet and an indoor cat, i thought i would try and see if i could keep her under cover. The tent was perfect. The manager rarely came into my apartment, only for rare repair incidents, and when he would come, i would drap a table cloth over the tent. At worst, if he came in unexpectedly because of an emergency, i don't remember that happening but if it had, the tent itself would not suggest that there was a cat toilet there.  the tent always did a great job of keeping the odor contained. The tent was crucial to my situation and i have good memories of it.  If i'd known they were going to start making a poorer quality tent, i would've saved the other one. It wasn't worn out. Just one piece of the frame came loose and i tried to get it to go back but it wouldn't. I abandoned it too easily probably because i was switching over to the Litter Robot at that time. At first i gave the tent 4 stars just now, but i have to change it to 5 because my tent lasted about 12 years and was still in good shape when i stopped using it, and it really helped me out by minimizing the mess and odor of a cat box, and camouflaged my catbox so that my cover was never blown. I have ordered the current model of the tent and am definitely concerned after reading the bad reviews. It sounds like maybe there is not much quality control and maybe some units are better cut than others. one can only speculate.  i have my fingers crossed.  i will update my review if the assessment changes.10/3/10 UpdateA year ago when i wrote the above, i ordered a new one of these, despite bad reviews.  I wanted the litter Maid to be in a tent, so i ordered it.  It was unusable.  The cover was much too tight for the frame, and it's a really cheap zipper, the little zipper teeth don't mesh together around the whole length of the zipper.I assembled it when i got it and since then, a year ago, it's sat unused in the spare bedroom. It was really diffcult getting it set up because the cover is too tight, but what made it unusable for me is that in order to clean the litter box i need to unzip it partially so i can pull back the tent flaps and get to the litter box.  The zipper is so flimsy and the cover so tight that extreme pressure has to be applied to open or close the zipper, unlike my old original litter maid tent which was tight enough but not a big production to unzip and re-zip. i never even thought about it.  The zipper on the new model i have is so flimsy that it would never hold up under the kind of puilling necessary to open and close it.I just now disassembled it because i'm going to be moving back to my house and i am packing stuff up. It was really hard to unzip and the teeth of the zipper were unmeshed in places.  Very poor.I left the 3 star rating instead of 1 star because the original version of these was so good, lasting a cat's lifetime without problems, i want to give some notice to the fact that it's a good idea with a good design and low cost compared to the fancy litter box disguises, and to the longevity and sturdiness of the original one.  But i would not recommend buying this one, although Amazon will take it back if it's defective so if anyone wants to try it out, your mileage may vary.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "it's the only alternative", "unixReviewTime": 1250467200, "reviewTime": "08 17, 2009"}

I then tape the little bubble things that poke through the top of the flap on the litter box and  to the flap.  (On the outside) This holds them in place when the flap goes up during operation.

I initially tried it on my 2 and it cleared up the diarrhea with the one immediately.  The other one who always had an issue with intermittent loose/watery stools, I had her on another regimen which over time gave her stools form, but it was rather costly and she didn't always like eating it (herbal regimen).  This, however, is very easy for me to give to her as she only requires one capsule of which I open into her bowl and mix with canned dog food then hand feed to make sure she eats it, and she eats it as if it were a treat.  I can then feed her the normal dry kibble in her bowl afterwards.  I am continuing this on a daily regiment with my one dog.  I recommend it.  The price is very reasonable and it is easily dispensed.  I am not certain, but I guess you could also just feed the entire capsule to your dog, but I prefer opening it so I know it will work quickly.Update:  August 2013.  I am now feeding 1 capsule daily to both of my dogs who had  loose stool issues.  Once their stools were firm (within a couple of days of opening capsule and adding to wet food), I am now dispensing the entire capsule and everything is fine.  I have one very finicky senior gal so she will only take her meds with peanut butter (she can't spit it out as I scoop it on the roof of her mouth).  Pill pockets work just as well with my other pooch, but since I have gone the route of peanut butter with one, they all get the peanut butter with pills...and it's much cheaper!

The idea has been around for centuries, but it's only been the last few decades that science understands why those who eat natural products like yogurt seem to be a bit healthier than others.Did you know that most of the immune system is in the gut?  Makes sense when you think about it.  When we eat, there are billions of bacteria, fungus, and viruses on our food.  (Viruses aren't a big problem, since they don't use food as a substrate; they look for living tissue to thrive in.) The stomach with its high acidity helps kill most bacteria and fungus, but some survive and get to the small and large intestine, where they can cause disease that is commonly called food poisoning.  Part of the problem is when there is missing 'good' bacteria that has been killed off or dies for some reason.  This niche may be filled by the bad bugs, leading to an unbalanced fauna in the gut.Pets have the same problem as we do.  And you know what a dog will eat; just about anything!

I never had a mechanical problem and my first couple of months with the product were uneventful. However, I soon found that it created much more work and hassel than a traditional litter box with plastic liners.One problem I faced was that if the storage bin became full, the clumps would pile up and the lid would not close. Sometimes, the clumps would even spill out of the side of the bin, creating a stinky mess. This problem was exacerbated by the fact that my cats had a tendency to use only one side of the litter box, so the bin would be full on that side in a short amount of time, causing extreme odor and spills. And, with 2 cats, it does not take long to fill that little storage bin, so if you have multiple cats, plan to empty it every couple of days.In addition, I found that the bottom of the box and the rake needed to be cleaned frequently so that they did not accumulate a build-up of crusty litter. If a build-up occurs on the bottom of the box, it will eventually become thick and hard enough that the rake will not be able to pass smoothly through the litter. After chiseling the dried litter off of the bottom of the box a few times (gross!) and dealing with the hassel of having to shake the contents of the storage bin in order to level it out, I finally decided that all of this hassel was not worth it and literally THREW THIS PRODUCT AWAY!

(i explained all the other troubleshooting things i'd done, which are described clearly in the manual.)well, here we are 25 days after ordering, so probably three weeks into daily use. i still have to turn it on and off manually. now, that wouldn't be a HUGE deal, since i'm in there anyway feeding the kittehs. however, because i can't sense when it's been 10 minutes since either cat went in, i have to hope that the clumps are fully formed. i think it has happened that way for me twice. the rest of the times, the mushy clod of unclumped kitty-pee mixed with the clay litter sticks to the rake as it goes through its little journey. also doesn't sound like HUGE deal, does it? well...turns out that the rake doesn't hit the aforementioned sensors until it goes alllll the way to the receptacle end and then allll the way to the resting end. and it can't push through the litter if a big ol' piece of you-know-what is blocking the openings between the rake's teeth. so every time it runs now, i have to sit beside it and use the little toothed plastic scoop to try to get all the gunk out from between the teeth. usually it still hasn't pushed the litter into an even surface by then, so the litter forms little dunes at either end, and it can't get up into the resting position. and i don't want to leave it partially out of the resting position, because that's down the side of the box into the...work area, and a kitteh will ...work on it. so i spend at least as much time as i'd spend scooping a regular box that size to get it cleared out all the way, getting the glued-to-the-bottom gunk out, and cleaning the rake until i can get it far enough up out of the box that nothing will get on it.and the return policy is that you have to return the item in its original condition and packaging. well, i got yer packaging right here, but i am prettty sure that this does not qualify as original condition. oh, did i mention that the gunk gets all up on the track and the sides of the rake? so those have to be cleaned off with a paper towel or something every few days.the good news is that the cats took to it right away--one of them with no urging at all (in fact, while i was still setting it up), and the other when the old box got dirty enough. the bad news is that i'm losing my patience with this contraption and putting it out with the trash any minute. the big boxes--which are easy to scoop, even if that's no fun--are much easier for me. and for now they're in closets or otherwise out of the way, rather than having to be plugged in in the main room.when our third bathroom is finished, i'm aiming for a cat genie, the box with the washable granules that flushes fluid waste away and scoops the poop into a receptacle. it's three times the price of the littermaid, but i'm betting it won't be worse than this.(i can't remember ever writing a negative review before for a product, and certainly not one this negative. think how ..fill in your favorite adjective here.. i must have been to get back on amazon to look for this product again just to write this review. sad.)", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "wish i'd just lined the box with $100 bills.", "unixReviewTime": 1227484800, "reviewTime": "11 24, 2008"}

These units are generally reliable.  The biggest benefit is the odor control.  The dirty stuff is raked into a plastic catch-bin that has a lid.  The smell is kept to a minimum, until the catch-bin is too full and the lid doesn't close fully.My first LitterMaid's retractable power cord (on the rake) stopped recoiling into the unit, so it eventually got snagged on the rake, and it broke.  That was after more than 3 years of use.  Not bad for a product that runs at least 10-15 times a day (I've got 2 cats).  My second LitterMaid has been going strong since I replaced the last one well over 2 years ago.The most important thing I can suggest is using *premium* clumping litter.  I've been very happy with the ScoopAway brand.  Cheap litter breaks apart and makes a mess.  The next thing is to keep the litter level below the \"max fill\" line.  Too much litter causes the rake to bog down.  Also, cooking oil spray (pam) works very well to keep the clumps from sticking to the bottom.I use the \"disposable\" catch pans over and over until they crack.  I can normally get 2 or 3 months before I consider changing it out.  I can't imagine tossing it out after one filling.  That's a big expense, and a waste of money and a perfectly operable item.  I don't use a liner/bag in the catch.  Just dump the dirty stuff into a bag and out to the trash.  I have two cats and they can fill the catch-bin in 2 to 3 days.  Normally, I just dump the bin, use a scoop to quickly get the smaller bits missed by the rake, and that's it.  I have gone well over 6 months before doing any major cleaning of the box.If you have more than one cat, I would get the \"Mega\" model, since it is bigger.  The new Advanced model isn't getting good reviews here at Amazon, so I would keep away from that unit.The LitterMaids are a bit noisy.  That maybe the biggest drawback.  Also, it is not a perfect cleaner, and will leave little bits that need to be scooped by hand every few days.  There are times when litter will build up in the back of the pan, and the rake will cycle over and over until you level things off (this can mostly be avoided by not filling to the top fill line).  It takes a few weeks to work out all the kinks, but once you do, you will love it.I will always own a LitterMaid because it keeps the house smelling like we don't have cats.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Does the job", "unixReviewTime": 1162598400, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2006"}

The licking was the \"cause of death\" for at least one of them; I have another around that's still intact but looking rather haggard from being so well loved (so we have a new one as a 'spare').  She LOVES the FIVE squeakers, and it's a great soft, squishy size.  (FYI, my dog is a 7-year-old 70lb Golden Retriever female; she's typically somewhat gentle on stuffies, although she's certainly destroyed her fair share, too).  For MYYYY dog (and I know this doesn't work with all dogs), if she sees me cuddle and pet her toy for a while first before letting her play with it, she tends to not destroy it (or, at least, not as quickly).  I'm not sure if it's because it gets my scent on it or if she decides that my actions mean it's to be 'babied.\"  I guess I'm playing into her maternal instinct.  This has absolutely been her FAVORITE toy for the LONGEST of all, so I definitely recommend it if stuffies are at all an option for your dog.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Her faaaavorite!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1316131200, "reviewTime": "09 16, 2011"}

I removed the batting from the rest of the body and placed Mr.s Bill's head with the soundmaker inside into a long men's sock (think sock monkey). I placed more batting around Mr. Bill's head to give soundmaker more cushioning.  Suggestion: it may be a good idea to use packing tape on the outside of the soundmaker itself to keep it intact (just in case you have dog that likes to chew). One sock is not enough cushion surrounding Mr. Bill's head though because holes can be made easily into just one sock layer and the jaw pressure from a dog's mouth could break the plastic on the soundmaker. Because of this, I suggest 2-3 socks (short or long on the inside) with the outermost sock long because then you can tie 2-3 knots at the end.  What you have is a long body that you can draw some eyes on with permanent marker on one end of the body and the knots at the other end will be like a rope toy.Pros from this design:-dog can play with either end of the toy.-person can throw toy (without much drool) with the knotted end easily.-more stuffing= more protection for the soundmaker you wanted to reuse.-it's easier to notice when the toy is being destroyed- then you just rewrap in another sock!Toy Diagram (Size approximate):[--10 inches long---] & 2-3 inches wide/~~~~~~~~~\\|~O~~~~~~~||~O~~~~~~~|--^-^-^--\\|~~~~~~~~~|--~-~-~--/\\~~~~~~~~~/", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Soundmaker lasts a long time if you remake it into another toy.", "unixReviewTime": 1296259200, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2011"}

We remember Mr Bill (telling our age here) and this was a great reminder.  We have an 8-month old shepherd mix that is scared of the Mr Bill (which thrills the Lab as he can torment the puppy). I bought the puppy the Lambchop and he torments us all with the squeaker but he is happy. These toys have lasted longer with my dogs than any other toys I have bought. Things like a loofa toy don't last 10 minutes and even the stuffingless toys are torns to shreds in short order.  I have had these two over a month now and only had to do minor repair. Though these toys do have stuffing so you have to watch your dogs, only portions of the toy rip easily for access to the stuffing (like the face). I have taught the puppy that if he tears his toy, \"mommy\" will just sew it up with dental floss and then he has to find a new place to tear. He learned quickly and no longer destroys every toy when it arrives! (If you do this, do yourself a favor and use the regular unflavored dental floss. I made the mistake of using a mint floss the first time I sewed up Lambchop and the puppy licked the poor lamby until it was one big spitball.) It turned out that both the puppy and the Lab are enamored with Lambchop and I was about to order two more but when I read the tag I discoverd these are made in China. I am usually very careful about food and toys that are made in China but had neglected to check this item. My vet says you need to be careful - particularly of the dye on toys made in China - and Mr Bill is heavily dyed.

These toys are among the best plush dog toys out there, and we've tried several. I don't think any are truly \"indestructible\" since there's always a dog somewhere that will defy that claim, but these are well made and worth buying for the majority of dogs.  Just be *sure* to buy the size that suits your dog; don't buy one too small that can be swallowed easily!  Dr. Noys' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack, and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch. (Squeakers are not indestructible; that's why they include an extra. But the advantage here is that they are very secure, and can't be eaten.) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys. Or you can remove the squeaker if it drives you crazy! ;-)Pay attention to the sizes listed: extra-small is really small, best for only the tiniest toy breeds or for small puppies. Medium will work for most dogs, but if your dog is a shredder, loves to destroy plush toys, only get the large sizes. If you have certain breeds, like Staffordshire terriers and bull dogs, then perhaps another toy would be a wiser choice. You know your dog.So if you're tired of buying so-called \"dog toys\" that are really glorified baby toys and are easily destroyed, try these. Ours have lasted for two years with hard play, only replacing the squeakers.  Even better, they're usually included in the Amazon 4-for-3 promotion, so you can get one free if you buy four!

Our dog is not a \"sit down and try to rip apart\" kind of dog, but she does love to play tug-o-war!  I usually grip the head while she grabs onto either the squeaking body or one of the limbs, and she hops and pulls and shakes and play-growls until she gets too thirsty to continue.  Hubby and I also play keep-away with the bear, tossing it back and forth so she'll run between us for some exercise (she's not much of a retriever).  Sometimes she'll pick up the bear and bring it over to me to let me know it's time to play, but otherwise she really doesn't play with the bear on her own.  Not the fault of the bear, it's just the way my sheltie is, and I hope it gives you a better idea of how this bear might hold up with your dog.This bear came with a free replacement squeaker, which I placed inside the fleece bag that contains the other squeaker, for extra squeaking fun.  Probably because of the extra protection the fleece gives, both squeakers have survived my little girl's needle sharp teeth.  The fleece thing inside the bear also gives it bulk, without that messy stuffing that dogs so love to pull out.  I could hear and feel stitches pop on occasion while playing tug-o-war, but this toy really has held up well compared to other plush dog toys.  For 5 months, this bear looked perfect, other than the slobber on it.  Our bear has about three sizeable holes and is missing a bit of fur on its chest, which all happened in the last month, but we still use it because there's no stuffing in the bear.  I'm currently looking for another Dr. Noys toy as a replacement, when that teddy bear goes to tug-o-war heaven.In addition to being very sturdy, this bear is super cute.  I have a photo of the Dr. Noys teddy bear in the arms of my sheltie who was laying down, and it's a photo I'll cherish forever.**UPDATE**  We've purchased our 2nd Dr. Noys teddy bear in medium size.  I tried buying regular stuffed animals, the kind intended for kids, at second hand stores but they all got pulled apart.

I don't think any are truly \"indestructible\" since there's always a dog somewhere that will defy that claim, but these are well made and worth buying for the majority of dogs.  Just be *sure* to buy the size that suits your dog; don't buy one too small that can be swallowed easily!  Dr. Noys' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack, and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch. (Squeakers are not indestructible; that's why they include an extra. But the advantage here is that they are very secure, and can't be eaten.) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys. Or you can remove the squeaker if it drives you crazy! ;-)  In the larger sizes you can replace the squeaker with a tennis ball for active dogs.Pay attention to the sizes listed: extra-small is really small, best for only the tiniest toy breeds or for small puppies. Medium will work for most dogs, but if your dog is a shredder, loves to destroy plush toys, only get the large sizes. If you have certain breeds, like Staffordshire terriers and bull dogs, then perhaps another toy would be a wiser choice. You know your dog.So if you're tired of buying so-called \"dog toys\" that are really glorified baby toys and easily destroyed, try these. Ours have lasted for two years with hard play, only replacing the squeakers. Even better, they're usually included in the Amazon 4-for-3 promotion, so you can get one free if you buy four (smaller sizes)!  That way you can test out different designs, or save one for later.

Held up quite well (looked perfect for the first 5 months), so I decided to get another Dr. Noys toy for my little girl, as she loves stuffed toys.I don't use this medium-size Frosty Dog for tug-o-war, as it's a bit too small, she ends up accidentally biting my fingers when she tries to get a better grip on the toy (didn't have that problem with the medium size teddy bear).So instead, my husband and I play keep-away with the Frosty Dog, tossing it back and forth so she'll run between us for some exercise (she's not much of a retriever).  When we throw it short so she has a chance to get the toy, she pounces on it and prances around with it in her mouth like it's the best thing ever.  She'll also run to her toy box and select this toy when my husband is laying on the floor doing back exercises, and she'll plop the Frosty Dog on his chest as a not-so-subtle way of saying \"Since you're down here at my level, play with me!\".  Sometimes when our sheltie is super happy, she'll pick the Frosty Dog up and hold it in her mouth for a minute, squeaking the toy every couple seconds, just for the joy of it.  The squeaker has held up great over 2 months of her joyful squeaking.  She simply loves this toy.My dog is not a determined toy destroyer, thankfully.  But, based on my experience with my other Dr. Noys teddy bear toy, their toys are built to be far superior to other plush toys.**UPDATE**  September 13th, 2008:  Last week, I had to take this toy away because Zoey had managed to pluck open the side of the Frosty Dog's face, exposing the irresistible stuffing inside.  Curses!  If I had sewing skills, I'd take upholstery thread (tough stuff!) and sew it back up.  But, I don't have sewing skills.  Double curses!  I'm searching for a new toy.  *sigh*  Still, the Frosty Dog lasted over 4 months, that's not too bad.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Gotta love Dr. Noys dog toys", "unixReviewTime": 1214006400, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2008"}

You can also make a natural spray using 1 cup distilled water, several drops of an essential oil like cedar wood, citronella, lavendar, peppermint.  You need to also add a tsp of castile soap so the essential oils will mix with the water.  Spray on your hands and rub all over your dog's coat before it goes outdoors in areas where there could be pests.  Re-apply every 2 hrs.  This is safe for pets and works; nothing harmful.  Don't get the spray mixture in their eyes, nose and mouth.  Vets say these are safe but that's not true.  The companies also only test these products for 30-90 days because they know that longer useage will show damage to the animal's liver.

They all had fleas after I forgot to treat my dog before I went on a lengthy vacation and one of my cats ended up living outside for two weeks (escaped while I was on vacation).  Anyway, I was so worried and upset when I discovered that my pets had fleas.  I gave them all flea baths, picked off live fleas, gave them other flea treatments that didn't seem to work (the store-bought flea drops, for example), washed linens, and I still could not get rid of them or even see a dent in the population.  That's when I decided to start hunting online for a solution since taking them all to the vet would be very expensive.I bought the large dog Advantage (>55 lbs) with the intent to divide it amongst my pets.  I used all but 0.5 ml of one vial for the first treatment.  I have not treated them a second time yet, but they are due very soon.  After treatment, the place on their back was not greasy.  In fact, by the second day, I couldn't even tell they had something put on their backs, and it didn't smell bad.  It did not smell AT ALL.  On day one, I found quite a few fleas laying around on the bed blanket. They had evidently jumped off the pets.  They seemed very confused and slow, but were still alive.  I made sure I killed them in case they were only temporarily impaired.  By the next day, I could find no evidence of fleas on my pets....not even any flea debris (I guess the pets had groomed themselves to remove it). All the pets were extremely thankful for treatment and extra loving after they no longer had fleas pestering them.I've continued to snuggle with my pets, checking them daily for fleas or signs of them, and monitor the bedding for any evidence of fleas.  NOTHING to be seen or found!  I am so happy with the Advantage flea treatment!  I will treat them all again in a few days in order to make sure any new eggs hatching don't re-infest the pets.I put 1 ml each on a 13 lb rat terrier, 20 lb cat, and 16 lb cat.  On my smaller 6 lb cat, I administered 0.5 ml.  I certainly wanted to make sure I gave them enough since I think I had a serious flea problem and knew some of the medicine would be rubbed off onto their surroundings.  They suffered no ill effects, only benefits, from the Advantage.  I benefited greatly by only spending $31.50 on Advantage that would treat all of my pets (4) for 4 months (plus 2 large pets for another month OR the dog for two more months, who is really the one who needs protection since he goes potty outside).
