I have two dogs and the second one started this habit and taught it to our first dog.  So disgusting!  As suggested by others we doubled the dosage and so far (about six months plus) it's been working I would say about 90% of the time (that we can tell).My husband and I work long hours so they are in our side yard (about 15 x 45) for many hours by themselves with a door to the garage.  Though we walk them in the morning and then check the side yard for any deposits before we leave for work, before using this product, it was not uncommon for us to come home to dogs with horrible breath and a side yard of half-eaten piles.  We also had a dog walker come 2-3 times a week in the middle of the day to walk them again (and pick up any piles) to alleviate this problem.  However, we still ecountered this problem rather frequently.  The poor dogs really suffered for it too because we didn't want them anywhere near us at night because they smelled so disgusting.With this product, we believe that the habit has stopped, if not all the way, at least to a significant degree.  Other than I think twice in the last six months, we now come home to dogs that don't gross us out with their bad breath anymore.  And everyone is much happier for it.One more thing:  Our first dog was starting to get finicky with his food.  I don't know if this powder was to blame or if it's a supplement that we also give to him.  But what I found out works really well are those liver biscotti sprinkles.  Just adding a bit of those to the top of his dry dog food really helps with his finishing his food.

She'd been living in multi-dog households (meaning four dogs or more) for her entire life. We just have one other dog, her brother. She immediately began ingesting feces from both her and her brother. I'm not sure if this is a habit from living with many other dogs or was brought on by the stress of being in a new home, but I was determined to stop it.We tried a product from Drs. Foster and Smith called Distaste and it worked quite well, but my male dog wasn't terribly thrilled with it-- it came in chew form and he didn't seem to like them. So I found this SEP and was glad to see it's something mixed into their food. It does not work as well as the Distaste, but seems to discourage her. All winter I have noticed my female picking up frozen specimens and marching around the yard with them... but she doesn't seem to be eating them. I plan to double the dose, as some other reviewers have noted, and we'll see how things go through the spring. We are typically quick about cleaning up after them, particularly now that we can see the ground, but occasionally we miss a pile. I'm hoping that the problems we had this winter with the SEP not working well were maybe because the feces were frozen, and now that things are thawing, maybe the SEP will discourage her more strongly.So bottom line, it seems to be working fairly well, but has not broken the habit completely. My only other comment is the smell of the product itself. It smells like Pixie Stick dust, or something similarly sweet/sour and I find the smell really awful.

I bought it at Lowe's for about the same price on Amazon a few weeks ago.  A couple problems: the hook at the top slides around the short section of wire on the cage that it hooks on (maybe an inch total).  Just means that it doesn't sit perfectly level.  The problem with that is that the birds don't like sitting on the downward-sloping part, so they only use the upward sloping part.  I'm going to try modding it so the hook isn't detachable and doesn't slide, but just stays in the middle so it's level.  The other issue is that the birds don't like sitting on the front/back of the suet cage, I think because it moves around a lot when they land, but every time they try it, there's a lot of wing flapping for a few seconds before they give up and use the other feeder.  This might get better with time.  If it does, I will update this review.  For now, I would say it's so-so for a suet feeder.  I've been looking at nicer more expensive ones, but I'll give this another month (and update this review!)UPDATE: The feeder made it through the season, but I don't think I'd buy again.  Not even sure if I'll put it out next year.  I have another feeder that has space for suet on each side.  That suet gets eaten REALLY quickly, while the one in the cage lasts long enough to start molding (several weeks).

When I'm cleaning it they pace around me like a child waiting for their teddy bear to come out of the wash. When I had one cat the bin needed to be emptied once a week. Now with 2 it's more like every 3 days. I line the bin with a little trash bag and it works great. No need to buy the expensive receptacles. Every so often I'll have to use the special litter scoop that comes with it to scrape some \"left over\" off the rake. It does make a noise but it's not that loud. I recommend leaving it in a closet or laundry room. Guests always ask why my boiler room is making noise. The noise doesn't bother my cats, they actually come running to watch it work. It is, however, the only litter box they've ever known.The Catch: I bought the box in April and had no problems until late October when I realized the box was getting very full. The censors had stopped working. I called their customer service, who's pre-recorded message makes you think you've called the wrong number (they start talking about tools), and spoke with some friendly but not 100% knowledgeable people. They gave me all kinds of instructions on how to fix it myself like dusting off the censors, \"re-setting\" the box by clicking the switches 10 times each, etc. All of these things I tried as they are in the instructions but I humored them. Finally they gave me instructions on how to get a new box so now I'm in the process of mailing the wire that powers the rake, the battery compartment cover, my receipt, and $10 so I can get a new one. I'm not too happy that I had to destroy my box with no guarantee they will send me a new one but I understand why they make you do it.The Moral of the Story: Nothing makes a cat happier than a clean littler box and now that it's broken I simply can't keep it clean enough for them (in their opinions). I'm going to get the replacement and use it until it breaks too but I think I'm going to look into the toilet training kit.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Love - Hate relationship", "unixReviewTime": 1164067200, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2006"}
{"reviewerID": "A1QCJOGQL05KRI", "asin": "B00005MF9T", "reviewerName": "Jaw", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "I gave 5 stars because i've had three Litter Maids over about 12-13 years and have always been very grateful not to have to clean the catbox--i was able to forget about it for at least a couple of weeks at a time, sometimes much more. I have only one small cat.  You can't beat not having to think about the catbox, it's almost like not having one at all--compared to the old fashion litter box.I first saw the Litter Maid in the LA Times Magazine around 1995, there was a full page ad, and you could pay in three installments, it was expensive, at least a couple hundred.  Catbox scooping depressed me so i ordered one.  Mine worked right out of the box.it's always tricky putting the right amount of litter in.  If i put too much, it just keeps recycling and raking until i take some out.  Following the instructions, i found that there would be too much litter and the machine would malfunction, but if i put it lower than the limit line, it would be fine.I had some kind of technical problem in the beginning, i can't remember what, and was pleased with their tech support, they took care of me, way back then.After a few years, it stopped working and i gladly got another one.  At some point, i began using Litter Pearls cat litter in it when that first came out.  That was yet another technical advance for my situation.  The Litter Pearls absorbed the urine so there was less stuff getting scooped into the box, and i was able to go even longer without being reminded of the litter box.In the beginning, Litter Pearls was just regular little round pearls. Then, my pet store came out with \"lite tracking litter pearls\" which were not round. They made them irregular shaped and rough, to prevent tracking i guess. That new light tracking style did not agree with my Litter Maid.  It was too granular and it jammed up the mechanism.  My pet store stopped carrying the regular non-lite tracking kind of Litter Pearls, so i had to search for an alternative.The combination of those little round litter balls and the Litter Maid did great things for my quality of life.  I did not want to go backwards into using the old fashioned kind of litter. I was ready to buy the regular Litter Pearls from the company in another state, (i called around) if necessary, or on eBay, but i was able to find another brand that had the round balls in a local store, the brand is Litter Secret, i couldn't find the product on the web though.As long as i had the little round ball litter, not the lite tracking kind, my Litter Maid performed consistently.  The second one lasted several more years with never a mechanical problem.  Long ago, i got the tent. I would always use a tent with the Litter Maid.  For me, the less evidence of a litter box the better.The Litter Maid rake did not clean easily and with my policy of not paying a lot of attention to the litter box, eventually the second Litter Maid got messy and the price had come way down on them, so i decided rather than clean it, i'd just get a new one.  the motor was still working fine, there was no problem with it after several years. I just didn't feel like cleaning it, was working lots of overtime and my job and felt i could afford a new one. I've had the third one for several more years, it has been very low maintenance, no mechanical problems, i just have cleaned it every few weeks, i'm not sure how often, maybe 2 weeks, maybe more, it seems long between times when i have to deal with it.Recently it stopped working.  The light was on but without warning, it wouldn't become active, it just sat there.I got a Litter Robot to replace it, because of the great reviews and decided i would try a change, since LItter Robot will let you return it for 60 days.  I'm still evaluating the Litter Robot, but there are some things that so far, i like better about the Litter Maid, one is, i didnt' have to regularly clean the Litter Maid, just take out the plastic containers, and then do a big cleaning once in a great while.  I think i'm going to have to clean the Litter Robot more often.The Litter Maid plastic containers were easier for me to switch out and replace than the plastic bags for the Litter Robot, less struggle, less time spent bending over the \"dreaded area.\"  And more secure feeling because stiff plastic is thicker than a plastic bag.Being inside the tent, the LItter Maid didn't have anything directly exposed to open air, whereas the Robot sits there with its door open and litter sitting out there in contact with the rest of the world.  Having said all of that, the LItter Robot is very cool.  More ingenious than the LItter Maid.  anyone could dream up the LItter Maid.  It would take a special kind of mind to think up the Litter Robot.  Watching it do its thing is something to behold, in terms of human engineering.  I was very happy with the LItter Maid, my three worked reliably and flawlessly each one for many years.  I didn't have to deal with tech support.  But again, i had only one small cat.Oh, i almost forgot. My cat always liked to use only one side of the Litter Maid, so the waste would pile up on one end of the plastic container, causing it to fill up faster, only on that side, than it would if it had been distributed evenly.  When it fills up and doesn't close completely, that's when i can smell it and i go into action to change the container, but i alway would find that half the container wasn't used, it was empty on one side, full on the other. This never affected the mechanical performance of the Litter Maid itself.Update:  10/3/10I have just retired my most recent Litter Maid which i started using a year ago.  I was having a very hard time with it.  It worked well as far as the motor and everything it's supposed to do, but the problem  was with the litter (crystals). The crystals were getting saturated in only about 4 days and if i didn't change the litter, my cat would pee on the floor cover that i kept under the litter maid.  That is way too frequent to have to deal with cat sewage, by my standards.  Urine was getting all over the box and under the box. I thought the litter maid was leaking but couldn't find any openings.  It took me a long time to figure out that my cat's hyperthyroid condition was causing her to excessively urinate.  When i realized it, about two months ago, i doubled her medication and the problem has gone away. but she continued to refuse to use the Litter Maid, i think it must've developed an odor because of all the urine all over it, i tried to wipe it off but far from perfectly i'm sure.  Even though the crystals weren't saturated at all, she was peeing on the floor cover.  So i have just replaced the Litter Maid with a ScoopFree automatic box. So far it's working great. I took the Litter Maid outside, cleaned it as best i could with diluted Simple Green spray, it looks ok, i put it some big plastic bags and will keep it in the garage.  It has been working very well.  A real trooper.I want to say that i appreciate the Litter Maid, it served me well for about 16 or more years, about 5 of them over those years, two were thrown out not because they wore out but because they were dirty so in my experience they have worked well. I never had a problem with the motors, and i was always impressed at the way it just kept raking over and over, never giving out.This is different from some peoples' experience.  I want say that i have always used Litter Pearls crystals in the litter Maid, not clay or clumping litter, and that may be why i haven't had the same problems some have had.  I would recommend using crystal litter with it, but in my experience, it had to be the rounded kind, not the trackless/lite tracking kind which are irregularly shaped.  The trackless kind were too abrasive and jagged for the litter maid, they jammed it up, causing the rake to come to a painful creaking halt in mid cycle. But the rounded ones work well, they just aren't easy to find because people tend to prefer lite tracking litter.  But other than that, the crystals have always worked great in the Litter Maid.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "not perfect but i've loved them", "unixReviewTime": 1190419200, "reviewTime": "09 22, 2007"}

This LitterMaid LM500 Automated Litter Box was the first automated solution we tried.

I'll note that we didn't even try having this be the \"only\" litter box in our home! We had two others there too. We just wanted to see how well this worked. The storage container would get jammed in the open position, so that it did not do a good job of managing stench.However, we could have dealt with those issues. We could have cleaned the tines daily, and pushed down the lid ourselves regularly. The real problem was far more serious.First, understand how this works. The system sense motion and then X minutes after the cat has left the area, the tines move across, dragging any solids and clumps with it, pushing those items into the receptacle plastic box at the far end. Then the tines return to their original position and wait for a new visit.What happened with our unit would be that the tines would decide that they were ALWAYS ON and would keep going back and forth, back and forth, driving the poor kitties to distraction. There was no way they were going to jump in there and try to do their business while a set of metal tines was growling towards them!We tried several times to fix this, but it really just wasn't worth it.

I mean cleaning completely, with a new coat of scotch-guard on the pan surface and fresh litter refilled.And that may not make a difference if you have a cat that aims for the plastic tines. And cleaning those is kinda nasty. I've noticed that a new version is out with metal tines.  Maybe the manufacturer's cat had good aim too.Since writing the review below we got a cat with exceptional aim. He could jam up that thing in one session. We were cleaning it every day, and finally opted this year to get a plain old deep rectangular litter pan with scoopable litter and ditch the Litter Maid.  Heck - we were in cleaning it everyday anyway due to our 'artistic' new cat.---------------------------------------I have three cats, all indoor, and you can imagine I've tried about every kind of litter to come up with something workable for both me and the cats.I've had a LitterMate (the larger size) for almost a year now and think this is the next best thing to sliced bread. we liked it so well, we've recently gotten the regular sized one as well since the cats were giving the one we had such a workout.Pros:Our dogs no longer go litter-diving for 'snacks'. The mechanism scares them and most of the contents are now hidden away in the plastic container.The cats are only fascinated by the workings of the litterbox and had no problem adjusting. The oldest was 6, the youngest 5 months.Scoopable litter + three cats previously meant 2-3 times a day  scooping the litterbox. One LitterMate + three cats = 2-3 times a week tray dumping.  The trays are easily reused, making them more economical.The box itself has been dumped and cleaned every other month. The comb is held in place by two screws and is easily removed from the engine to be cleaned. I soak the bottom pan and comb in an antibacterial  cleaner solution, and after it's dry use Scotchguard on both.The house I live in is small - there are few places to hide litterbox odor. This does it effectively.One of our cats like to dig his way to China when he covers his stuff.  I was worried that the scratches on the bottom of the pan would cause more sticking than normal, but a generous coating of Scotchguard keeps things moving along in spite of the battle scars in the LitterMaid.Cons:Yes - litter does escape underneath a little, but with the activities of three cats we were always vaccuming around the litter box anyway - no difference there.The litter flinging problem happened once to me - every time afterwards I threw the garbage bag on top of the tray while I removed it, then just tipped it into the bag. Again, no biggie.Tips:Those lines in the litterbox aren't kidding - don't fill the box over the red line, or the motor will jam.When they say Premium clumping litter, they mean it.  The alternative is a constantly jammed motor.Whenever you empty the tray, pass the scraper through the pan to make sure that nothing escaped the comb along the bottom. Those spots can build up and cause a jam too.If stuff sticks too often to the comb or bottom, it usually means it's time to dumb the entire box and clean and re-coat it with nonsitck spray.

None really prevents it from performing its function (eventually) but all add up to a real pain. One problem is that the plastic boxes that the cat manure is scooped up into do not fit very well into their canister. As a result cat litter seeps through the gaps and you end up having to vacuum underneath every few days. It should not have been that difficult to make a better fitting plastic box or area where it is to be placed.A second problem is that the red \"fill\" line is misleading. If litter is filled up to that point (or even fairly close to it) the machine jams. As a result, to prevent jamming, one needs to fill the device with far below its full capacity. This, in turn, necessitates filling the machine with more cat litter than should be the case (i.e., twice a week instead of once).A third problem is that the rakes, many times, get jammed due to filling up with litter. The rakes should have been made further apart to reduce this.In short, the machine does do its job but with a few relatively minor modifications (that should have been easy to spot for the manufacturer) this machine could have been much improved._______________________________Update:After less than one year machine breaks down and needs to be replaced.

It took a few trials to find a litter that worked well but I settled on Scoop Away. Yes, as some reviewers have mentioned, sometimes it does stick to the bottom and you will have to use the scooper to scrape it up or clean the rakes sometimes. Then, I just turn it on and off and it will rake everything up.  It only takes me a few seconds to check for any stuck spots or even out the litter, turn it on and off to make it rake and then add a little new litter to the top (so the cats think it's nice and clean). :-) It's not completely \"no work\" but it is a lot less work than a \"manual\" litterbox and stays smelling cleaner than manual boxes.  I do use larger plastic grocery bags in the receptacle. It's a lot cheaper than throwing away receptacles every 3-4 days and it's alot easier to clean. Believe me, I do not like trying to pry those receptacles out when it is completely full.  You have to stick your fingers inside to grab onto it (YUCK!) and it's heavy and hard to get out sometimes dumping litter and stuff all over the place (double YUCK).The Seller on Ebay was selling the one I bought with a \"super charged\" motor (which is in the electrical cord). It worked pretty good for almost a year. Apparently, unlike the \"normal motor\", the stronger motor kept it from resetting sometimes when it would hit clumps that were too big for it.  It would attempt to plow right thru which sounds like a good thing, but it wasn't. Apparently the gears and/or sprokets which move the rake along are made of plastic and within a year they were stripped. It started out making a spinning sound once in awhile but would eventually go ahead and rake. One day I came home to a god awful sound. I found the rake stuck right in the middle of the box, gears just spinning and making a heck of a racket. This was enough to scare away ALL 4 cats from the ONLY litterbox. Needless to say we had some accidents. 3 of my cats \"recovered\" and would go back to the disconnected box, but my 20 year old cat was traumatized and refused to use it. So I had to set up the manual box. I'm STILL working with her trying to get her to stop going elsewhere because of this.I took the Littermaid to a repair shop and they knew immediately that the gears were stripped because they'd seen it before. They said they couldn't repair it because they couldn't get parts.I contacted the Ebay Seller who said it was still under warranty. I had to pay shipping to and from the Seller though which was not cheap. The 2nd supercharged Littermaid started doing the same thing after less than 6 months and the Seller says this one is not under warranty. Apparently, the warranty does not extend to the replacement that they sent me which I think is a rip-off considering how expensive these things are.While the 1st Littermaid was being repaired, I went ahead and bought another \"regular\" (not supercharged) Littermaid from Petsmart. I've had it 8 months and had no skipping problems so far. I think the \"supercharged\" motor caused all my problems, but KittenKaboodle refuses to acknowledge this and refused to warranty the 2nd box that they sent me.So, overall it's great when it works, but it could use a few improvements. The bottom of the pan needs to be made of something more \"non-stick\" so the rake can get thru some of the larger wet spots and/or the gears need to be made of something stronger to be able to take a stronger motor that can get thru the stuck on clumps (and not strip the gears). Also I would like to see a slightly larger receptacle on the larger models. They are made for a multi cat household but with only one litterbox it fills up pretty fast. With 2 litterboxes it's not too bad though. I would also like to see some sort of hood like other auto litterboxes that I've seen.

You may work around this requirement by using plain grocery bags to line the receptacles, but after a few weeks of use the receptacles break anyway.Third, the capacity is lacking; When I got my second cat I found out I had to empty out the machine practically every day. If I waited for the second day, the container would overfill, sometimes because all the clumps were on the same side, keeping the lid open (you can imagine the smell)Finally, my youngest cat has a very fragile stomach. Well let me tell you, the raking process is not designed to handle runny poo. This was the last drop in the bucket, which prompted me to do some research on the web. Six months ago, I bought the litter-robot (litter-robot dot com), and my two cats and I couldn't be more satisfied.In summary, the LitterMaid is great if you only have one cat who never gets the runs.

Try setting it up with the power off for a few days and then turn it on after the cat gets use to using the box. The only other issue is that there is a raking motion that pushes all the waste forward but it also pushes good litter with it so the end result is good litter gets dumped into the plastic bin.  I had the option of buying the newer unit but read so many bad reviews that I decided to go for one of the older models.  I also build a table with a hole in it.

A+++++I should tell you that I've had this litter box before..About 6 years ago I had 3 cats and bought one of these litter boxes to save my sanity and my back.

This litter is supposed to be better than the regular litter because it is more absorbent than the regular and it clumps and drys more quickly than the traditional kitty litter. Since the Littermaid Litter box rakes the litter 10 minutes after the cat leaves, you need a litter that can clump and dry quickly. Well, now I get this! Since I bought the litter box (2 weeks ago) I havent had any clogs and am actually using less Kitty litter than before since it clumps so well.The litterbox is turnkey provided you use the premium kitty litter. I am really glad I bought this product. I am happy...Oh, another point, MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE KITTY LITTER LEVEL BELOW THE SUGGESTED LINE.

It works as advertised and even though the replacement cartridges are expensive, they last a long time and actually cost us less than we were paying for litter alone.  We have now bought a second Scoop Free and find we only use three cartridges a month, and have never had to clean it except for waste that has gotten on the sides that needs to be wiped off, but we would have that problem no matter what type of box we used.If you are thinking about buying an automatic litter box I would suggest you buy the Scoop Free instead of this one.

I've always found them to be great, but not very long lived.My littermaids have serviced 2 cats at all times.  So, if you are a single cat house, you could reasonably expect 5-7 years of use from one of these.  The first unit's motor died.  The second, the spring in the power rake's cord broke, and couldn't reel in the cord anymore.  The third (my last) up and died, no warning or otherwise.  Just stopped running.My first Littermaid was the original.  It lasted about 4 years.  The next was the original \"Mega Advance\" and was the best when it was working.  That only lasted about 3-4 years.  The last Mega (not advance) lasted about 5-6 years, but was very noisy.This newer unit seems to be basically the same as the last Mega, but the motor is slightly more quiet and pushes the rake through the box at a faster clip.  Both nice improvements.  The included scoop has tines in it to clean out the rake, a great idea that only took 15 years....I've never run my Littermaids on batteries, always using the A/C plug.  If the power's out for a few hours, we can survive, or if needed, scoop.If there was a way to make the system a bit more quiet it would be perfect.Tips:1.  Don't over-fill the box.  Use the bottom (add litter) line as the top fill line.  If you fill to the top line, the system will not work as well.  This seems to be the #1 problem people have, adding too much litter.2.  Use a bit of cooking oil spray (Pam) on the bottom of the pan before you fill with litter.  I rarely clean ours, but when I do, I always spray the bottom of the pan and that really helps keep the box cleaner and helps keep the nasty stuff from getting stuck to the bottom.3.  Use high-quality clumping litter.  We get the big tub of Scoop-Away from Costco.  That lasts more than a month for us.4.  Re-use the waste containers.  They each should last a month or more. Just keep using them until they crack when you are removing to dump the contents.  Then replace.  Saves lots of money there.This would be a 5 star if it was just a bit more quiet overall.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Must have appliance for the lazy cat owner", "unixReviewTime": 1252540800, "reviewTime": "09 10, 2009"}

Must've been around 1994 or 95.  Not too long after that, i got the tent.  I went through about 3 or 4 Litter Maids in that time, the motors kept working but they got too dirty and it was time for a fresh one, was my thinking.  That one tent outlived all those litter Boxes.  For me, the tent was great, I liked that it was light weight. It wasn't too flimsy, i could always easily unzip it and zip it back.  Sorry to hear the new ones are poorer quality, i hate when that happens. I have ordered one because i am about to start using a Litter Maid again after a couple of years with a Litter Robot, and when i took the tent apart last time, when i got rid of the last Litter Maid, one piece of the frame wouldn't go back on, i don't know why. But i have to say that overall, that one tent i had certainly held up well. My cat is not rough on things so that may be part of my success with this item on my first experience.  At that time, i had recently moved into an apartment that didn't allow pets, but we already had the cat before we moved in so since she is small, quiet and an indoor cat, i thought i would try and see if i could keep her under cover. The tent was perfect. The manager rarely came into my apartment, only for rare repair incidents, and when he would come, i would drap a table cloth over the tent. At worst, if he came in unexpectedly because of an emergency, i don't remember that happening but if it had, the tent itself would not suggest that there was a cat toilet there.  the tent always did a great job of keeping the odor contained. The tent was crucial to my situation and i have good memories of it.  If i'd known they were going to start making a poorer quality tent, i would've saved the other one. It wasn't worn out. Just one piece of the frame came loose and i tried to get it to go back but it wouldn't. I abandoned it too easily probably because i was switching over to the Litter Robot at that time. At first i gave the tent 4 stars just now, but i have to change it to 5 because my tent lasted about 12 years and was still in good shape when i stopped using it, and it really helped me out by minimizing the mess and odor of a cat box, and camouflaged my catbox so that my cover was never blown. I have ordered the current model of the tent and am definitely concerned after reading the bad reviews. It sounds like maybe there is not much quality control and maybe some units are better cut than others. one can only speculate.  i have my fingers crossed.  i will update my review if the assessment changes.10/3/10 UpdateA year ago when i wrote the above, i ordered a new one of these, despite bad reviews.  I wanted the litter Maid to be in a tent, so i ordered it.  It was unusable.  The cover was much too tight for the frame, and it's a really cheap zipper, the little zipper teeth don't mesh together around the whole length of the zipper.I assembled it when i got it and since then, a year ago, it's sat unused in the spare bedroom. It was really diffcult getting it set up because the cover is too tight, but what made it unusable for me is that in order to clean the litter box i need to unzip it partially so i can pull back the tent flaps and get to the litter box.  The zipper is so flimsy and the cover so tight that extreme pressure has to be applied to open or close the zipper, unlike my old original litter maid tent which was tight enough but not a big production to unzip and re-zip. i never even thought about it.  The zipper on the new model i have is so flimsy that it would never hold up under the kind of puilling necessary to open and close it.I just now disassembled it because i'm going to be moving back to my house and i am packing stuff up. It was really hard to unzip and the teeth of the zipper were unmeshed in places.  Very poor.I left the 3 star rating instead of 1 star because the original version of these was so good, lasting a cat's lifetime without problems, i want to give some notice to the fact that it's a good idea with a good design and low cost compared to the fancy litter box disguises, and to the longevity and sturdiness of the original one.  But i would not recommend buying this one, although Amazon will take it back if it's defective so if anyone wants to try it out, your mileage may vary.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "it's the only alternative", "unixReviewTime": 1250467200, "reviewTime": "08 17, 2009"}

I then tape the little bubble things that poke through the top of the flap on the litter box and  to the flap.  (On the outside) This holds them in place when the flap goes up during operation.

I initially tried it on my 2 and it cleared up the diarrhea with the one immediately.  The other one who always had an issue with intermittent loose/watery stools, I had her on another regimen which over time gave her stools form, but it was rather costly and she didn't always like eating it (herbal regimen).  This, however, is very easy for me to give to her as she only requires one capsule of which I open into her bowl and mix with canned dog food then hand feed to make sure she eats it, and she eats it as if it were a treat.  I can then feed her the normal dry kibble in her bowl afterwards.  I am continuing this on a daily regiment with my one dog.  I recommend it.  The price is very reasonable and it is easily dispensed.  I am not certain, but I guess you could also just feed the entire capsule to your dog, but I prefer opening it so I know it will work quickly.Update:  August 2013.  I am now feeding 1 capsule daily to both of my dogs who had  loose stool issues.  Once their stools were firm (within a couple of days of opening capsule and adding to wet food), I am now dispensing the entire capsule and everything is fine.  I have one very finicky senior gal so she will only take her meds with peanut butter (she can't spit it out as I scoop it on the roof of her mouth).  Pill pockets work just as well with my other pooch, but since I have gone the route of peanut butter with one, they all get the peanut butter with pills...and it's much cheaper!

The idea has been around for centuries, but it's only been the last few decades that science understands why those who eat natural products like yogurt seem to be a bit healthier than others.Did you know that most of the immune system is in the gut?  Makes sense when you think about it.  When we eat, there are billions of bacteria, fungus, and viruses on our food.  (Viruses aren't a big problem, since they don't use food as a substrate; they look for living tissue to thrive in.) The stomach with its high acidity helps kill most bacteria and fungus, but some survive and get to the small and large intestine, where they can cause disease that is commonly called food poisoning.  Part of the problem is when there is missing 'good' bacteria that has been killed off or dies for some reason.  This niche may be filled by the bad bugs, leading to an unbalanced fauna in the gut.Pets have the same problem as we do.  And you know what a dog will eat; just about anything!

I never had a mechanical problem and my first couple of months with the product were uneventful. However, I soon found that it created much more work and hassel than a traditional litter box with plastic liners.One problem I faced was that if the storage bin became full, the clumps would pile up and the lid would not close. Sometimes, the clumps would even spill out of the side of the bin, creating a stinky mess. This problem was exacerbated by the fact that my cats had a tendency to use only one side of the litter box, so the bin would be full on that side in a short amount of time, causing extreme odor and spills. And, with 2 cats, it does not take long to fill that little storage bin, so if you have multiple cats, plan to empty it every couple of days.In addition, I found that the bottom of the box and the rake needed to be cleaned frequently so that they did not accumulate a build-up of crusty litter. If a build-up occurs on the bottom of the box, it will eventually become thick and hard enough that the rake will not be able to pass smoothly through the litter. After chiseling the dried litter off of the bottom of the box a few times (gross!) and dealing with the hassel of having to shake the contents of the storage bin in order to level it out, I finally decided that all of this hassel was not worth it and literally THREW THIS PRODUCT AWAY!

(i explained all the other troubleshooting things i'd done, which are described clearly in the manual.)well, here we are 25 days after ordering, so probably three weeks into daily use. i still have to turn it on and off manually. now, that wouldn't be a HUGE deal, since i'm in there anyway feeding the kittehs. however, because i can't sense when it's been 10 minutes since either cat went in, i have to hope that the clumps are fully formed. i think it has happened that way for me twice. the rest of the times, the mushy clod of unclumped kitty-pee mixed with the clay litter sticks to the rake as it goes through its little journey. also doesn't sound like HUGE deal, does it? well...turns out that the rake doesn't hit the aforementioned sensors until it goes alllll the way to the receptacle end and then allll the way to the resting end. and it can't push through the litter if a big ol' piece of you-know-what is blocking the openings between the rake's teeth. so every time it runs now, i have to sit beside it and use the little toothed plastic scoop to try to get all the gunk out from between the teeth. usually it still hasn't pushed the litter into an even surface by then, so the litter forms little dunes at either end, and it can't get up into the resting position. and i don't want to leave it partially out of the resting position, because that's down the side of the box into the...work area, and a kitteh will ...work on it. so i spend at least as much time as i'd spend scooping a regular box that size to get it cleared out all the way, getting the glued-to-the-bottom gunk out, and cleaning the rake until i can get it far enough up out of the box that nothing will get on it.and the return policy is that you have to return the item in its original condition and packaging. well, i got yer packaging right here, but i am prettty sure that this does not qualify as original condition. oh, did i mention that the gunk gets all up on the track and the sides of the rake? so those have to be cleaned off with a paper towel or something every few days.the good news is that the cats took to it right away--one of them with no urging at all (in fact, while i was still setting it up), and the other when the old box got dirty enough. the bad news is that i'm losing my patience with this contraption and putting it out with the trash any minute. the big boxes--which are easy to scoop, even if that's no fun--are much easier for me. and for now they're in closets or otherwise out of the way, rather than having to be plugged in in the main room.when our third bathroom is finished, i'm aiming for a cat genie, the box with the washable granules that flushes fluid waste away and scoops the poop into a receptacle. it's three times the price of the littermaid, but i'm betting it won't be worse than this.(i can't remember ever writing a negative review before for a product, and certainly not one this negative. think how ..fill in your favorite adjective here.. i must have been to get back on amazon to look for this product again just to write this review. sad.)", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "wish i'd just lined the box with $100 bills.", "unixReviewTime": 1227484800, "reviewTime": "11 24, 2008"}

These units are generally reliable.  The biggest benefit is the odor control.  The dirty stuff is raked into a plastic catch-bin that has a lid.  The smell is kept to a minimum, until the catch-bin is too full and the lid doesn't close fully.My first LitterMaid's retractable power cord (on the rake) stopped recoiling into the unit, so it eventually got snagged on the rake, and it broke.  That was after more than 3 years of use.  Not bad for a product that runs at least 10-15 times a day (I've got 2 cats).  My second LitterMaid has been going strong since I replaced the last one well over 2 years ago.The most important thing I can suggest is using *premium* clumping litter.  I've been very happy with the ScoopAway brand.  Cheap litter breaks apart and makes a mess.  The next thing is to keep the litter level below the \"max fill\" line.  Too much litter causes the rake to bog down.  Also, cooking oil spray (pam) works very well to keep the clumps from sticking to the bottom.I use the \"disposable\" catch pans over and over until they crack.  I can normally get 2 or 3 months before I consider changing it out.  I can't imagine tossing it out after one filling.  That's a big expense, and a waste of money and a perfectly operable item.  I don't use a liner/bag in the catch.  Just dump the dirty stuff into a bag and out to the trash.  I have two cats and they can fill the catch-bin in 2 to 3 days.  Normally, I just dump the bin, use a scoop to quickly get the smaller bits missed by the rake, and that's it.  I have gone well over 6 months before doing any major cleaning of the box.If you have more than one cat, I would get the \"Mega\" model, since it is bigger.  The new Advanced model isn't getting good reviews here at Amazon, so I would keep away from that unit.The LitterMaids are a bit noisy.  That maybe the biggest drawback.  Also, it is not a perfect cleaner, and will leave little bits that need to be scooped by hand every few days.  There are times when litter will build up in the back of the pan, and the rake will cycle over and over until you level things off (this can mostly be avoided by not filling to the top fill line).  It takes a few weeks to work out all the kinks, but once you do, you will love it.I will always own a LitterMaid because it keeps the house smelling like we don't have cats.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Does the job", "unixReviewTime": 1162598400, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2006"}

The licking was the \"cause of death\" for at least one of them; I have another around that's still intact but looking rather haggard from being so well loved (so we have a new one as a 'spare').  She LOVES the FIVE squeakers, and it's a great soft, squishy size.  (FYI, my dog is a 7-year-old 70lb Golden Retriever female; she's typically somewhat gentle on stuffies, although she's certainly destroyed her fair share, too).  For MYYYY dog (and I know this doesn't work with all dogs), if she sees me cuddle and pet her toy for a while first before letting her play with it, she tends to not destroy it (or, at least, not as quickly).  I'm not sure if it's because it gets my scent on it or if she decides that my actions mean it's to be 'babied.\"  I guess I'm playing into her maternal instinct.  This has absolutely been her FAVORITE toy for the LONGEST of all, so I definitely recommend it if stuffies are at all an option for your dog.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Her faaaavorite!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1316131200, "reviewTime": "09 16, 2011"}

I removed the batting from the rest of the body and placed Mr.s Bill's head with the soundmaker inside into a long men's sock (think sock monkey). I placed more batting around Mr. Bill's head to give soundmaker more cushioning.  Suggestion: it may be a good idea to use packing tape on the outside of the soundmaker itself to keep it intact (just in case you have dog that likes to chew). One sock is not enough cushion surrounding Mr. Bill's head though because holes can be made easily into just one sock layer and the jaw pressure from a dog's mouth could break the plastic on the soundmaker. Because of this, I suggest 2-3 socks (short or long on the inside) with the outermost sock long because then you can tie 2-3 knots at the end.  What you have is a long body that you can draw some eyes on with permanent marker on one end of the body and the knots at the other end will be like a rope toy.Pros from this design:-dog can play with either end of the toy.-person can throw toy (without much drool) with the knotted end easily.-more stuffing= more protection for the soundmaker you wanted to reuse.-it's easier to notice when the toy is being destroyed- then you just rewrap in another sock!Toy Diagram (Size approximate):[--10 inches long---] & 2-3 inches wide/~~~~~~~~~\\|~O~~~~~~~||~O~~~~~~~|--^-^-^--\\|~~~~~~~~~|--~-~-~--/\\~~~~~~~~~/", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Soundmaker lasts a long time if you remake it into another toy.", "unixReviewTime": 1296259200, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2011"}

We remember Mr Bill (telling our age here) and this was a great reminder.  We have an 8-month old shepherd mix that is scared of the Mr Bill (which thrills the Lab as he can torment the puppy). I bought the puppy the Lambchop and he torments us all with the squeaker but he is happy. These toys have lasted longer with my dogs than any other toys I have bought. Things like a loofa toy don't last 10 minutes and even the stuffingless toys are torns to shreds in short order.  I have had these two over a month now and only had to do minor repair. Though these toys do have stuffing so you have to watch your dogs, only portions of the toy rip easily for access to the stuffing (like the face). I have taught the puppy that if he tears his toy, \"mommy\" will just sew it up with dental floss and then he has to find a new place to tear. He learned quickly and no longer destroys every toy when it arrives! (If you do this, do yourself a favor and use the regular unflavored dental floss. I made the mistake of using a mint floss the first time I sewed up Lambchop and the puppy licked the poor lamby until it was one big spitball.) It turned out that both the puppy and the Lab are enamored with Lambchop and I was about to order two more but when I read the tag I discoverd these are made in China. I am usually very careful about food and toys that are made in China but had neglected to check this item. My vet says you need to be careful - particularly of the dye on toys made in China - and Mr Bill is heavily dyed.

These toys are among the best plush dog toys out there, and we've tried several. I don't think any are truly \"indestructible\" since there's always a dog somewhere that will defy that claim, but these are well made and worth buying for the majority of dogs.  Just be *sure* to buy the size that suits your dog; don't buy one too small that can be swallowed easily!  Dr. Noys' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack, and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch. (Squeakers are not indestructible; that's why they include an extra. But the advantage here is that they are very secure, and can't be eaten.) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys. Or you can remove the squeaker if it drives you crazy! ;-)Pay attention to the sizes listed: extra-small is really small, best for only the tiniest toy breeds or for small puppies. Medium will work for most dogs, but if your dog is a shredder, loves to destroy plush toys, only get the large sizes. If you have certain breeds, like Staffordshire terriers and bull dogs, then perhaps another toy would be a wiser choice. You know your dog.So if you're tired of buying so-called \"dog toys\" that are really glorified baby toys and are easily destroyed, try these. Ours have lasted for two years with hard play, only replacing the squeakers.  Even better, they're usually included in the Amazon 4-for-3 promotion, so you can get one free if you buy four!

Our dog is not a \"sit down and try to rip apart\" kind of dog, but she does love to play tug-o-war!  I usually grip the head while she grabs onto either the squeaking body or one of the limbs, and she hops and pulls and shakes and play-growls until she gets too thirsty to continue.  Hubby and I also play keep-away with the bear, tossing it back and forth so she'll run between us for some exercise (she's not much of a retriever).  Sometimes she'll pick up the bear and bring it over to me to let me know it's time to play, but otherwise she really doesn't play with the bear on her own.  Not the fault of the bear, it's just the way my sheltie is, and I hope it gives you a better idea of how this bear might hold up with your dog.This bear came with a free replacement squeaker, which I placed inside the fleece bag that contains the other squeaker, for extra squeaking fun.  Probably because of the extra protection the fleece gives, both squeakers have survived my little girl's needle sharp teeth.  The fleece thing inside the bear also gives it bulk, without that messy stuffing that dogs so love to pull out.  I could hear and feel stitches pop on occasion while playing tug-o-war, but this toy really has held up well compared to other plush dog toys.  For 5 months, this bear looked perfect, other than the slobber on it.  Our bear has about three sizeable holes and is missing a bit of fur on its chest, which all happened in the last month, but we still use it because there's no stuffing in the bear.  I'm currently looking for another Dr. Noys toy as a replacement, when that teddy bear goes to tug-o-war heaven.In addition to being very sturdy, this bear is super cute.  I have a photo of the Dr. Noys teddy bear in the arms of my sheltie who was laying down, and it's a photo I'll cherish forever.**UPDATE**  We've purchased our 2nd Dr. Noys teddy bear in medium size.  I tried buying regular stuffed animals, the kind intended for kids, at second hand stores but they all got pulled apart.

I don't think any are truly \"indestructible\" since there's always a dog somewhere that will defy that claim, but these are well made and worth buying for the majority of dogs.  Just be *sure* to buy the size that suits your dog; don't buy one too small that can be swallowed easily!  Dr. Noys' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack, and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch. (Squeakers are not indestructible; that's why they include an extra. But the advantage here is that they are very secure, and can't be eaten.) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys. Or you can remove the squeaker if it drives you crazy! ;-)  In the larger sizes you can replace the squeaker with a tennis ball for active dogs.Pay attention to the sizes listed: extra-small is really small, best for only the tiniest toy breeds or for small puppies. Medium will work for most dogs, but if your dog is a shredder, loves to destroy plush toys, only get the large sizes. If you have certain breeds, like Staffordshire terriers and bull dogs, then perhaps another toy would be a wiser choice. You know your dog.So if you're tired of buying so-called \"dog toys\" that are really glorified baby toys and easily destroyed, try these. Ours have lasted for two years with hard play, only replacing the squeakers. Even better, they're usually included in the Amazon 4-for-3 promotion, so you can get one free if you buy four (smaller sizes)!  That way you can test out different designs, or save one for later.

Held up quite well (looked perfect for the first 5 months), so I decided to get another Dr. Noys toy for my little girl, as she loves stuffed toys.I don't use this medium-size Frosty Dog for tug-o-war, as it's a bit too small, she ends up accidentally biting my fingers when she tries to get a better grip on the toy (didn't have that problem with the medium size teddy bear).So instead, my husband and I play keep-away with the Frosty Dog, tossing it back and forth so she'll run between us for some exercise (she's not much of a retriever).  When we throw it short so she has a chance to get the toy, she pounces on it and prances around with it in her mouth like it's the best thing ever.  She'll also run to her toy box and select this toy when my husband is laying on the floor doing back exercises, and she'll plop the Frosty Dog on his chest as a not-so-subtle way of saying \"Since you're down here at my level, play with me!\".  Sometimes when our sheltie is super happy, she'll pick the Frosty Dog up and hold it in her mouth for a minute, squeaking the toy every couple seconds, just for the joy of it.  The squeaker has held up great over 2 months of her joyful squeaking.  She simply loves this toy.My dog is not a determined toy destroyer, thankfully.  But, based on my experience with my other Dr. Noys teddy bear toy, their toys are built to be far superior to other plush toys.**UPDATE**  September 13th, 2008:  Last week, I had to take this toy away because Zoey had managed to pluck open the side of the Frosty Dog's face, exposing the irresistible stuffing inside.  Curses!  If I had sewing skills, I'd take upholstery thread (tough stuff!) and sew it back up.  But, I don't have sewing skills.  Double curses!  I'm searching for a new toy.  *sigh*  Still, the Frosty Dog lasted over 4 months, that's not too bad.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Gotta love Dr. Noys dog toys", "unixReviewTime": 1214006400, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2008"}

Spray on your hands and rub all over your dog's coat before it goes outdoors in areas where there could be pests.  Re-apply every 2 hrs.  This is safe for pets and works; nothing harmful.  Don't get the spray mixture in their eyes, nose and mouth.  Vets say these are safe but that's not true.  The companies also only test these products for 30-90 days because they know that longer useage will show damage to the animal's liver.

They all had fleas after I forgot to treat my dog before I went on a lengthy vacation and one of my cats ended up living outside for two weeks (escaped while I was on vacation).  Anyway, I was so worried and upset when I discovered that my pets had fleas.  I gave them all flea baths, picked off live fleas, gave them other flea treatments that didn't seem to work (the store-bought flea drops, for example), washed linens, and I still could not get rid of them or even see a dent in the population.  That's when I decided to start hunting online for a solution since taking them all to the vet would be very expensive.I bought the large dog Advantage (>55 lbs) with the intent to divide it amongst my pets.  I used all but 0.5 ml of one vial for the first treatment.  I have not treated them a second time yet, but they are due very soon.  After treatment, the place on their back was not greasy.  In fact, by the second day, I couldn't even tell they had something put on their backs, and it didn't smell bad.  It did not smell AT ALL.  On day one, I found quite a few fleas laying around on the bed blanket. They had evidently jumped off the pets.  They seemed very confused and slow, but were still alive.  I made sure I killed them in case they were only temporarily impaired.  By the next day, I could find no evidence of fleas on my pets....not even any flea debris (I guess the pets had groomed themselves to remove it). All the pets were extremely thankful for treatment and extra loving after they no longer had fleas pestering them.I've continued to snuggle with my pets, checking them daily for fleas or signs of them, and monitor the bedding for any evidence of fleas.  NOTHING to be seen or found!  I am so happy with the Advantage flea treatment!  I will treat them all again in a few days in order to make sure any new eggs hatching don't re-infest the pets.I put 1 ml each on a 13 lb rat terrier, 20 lb cat, and 16 lb cat.  On my smaller 6 lb cat, I administered 0.5 ml.  I certainly wanted to make sure I gave them enough since I think I had a serious flea problem and knew some of the medicine would be rubbed off onto their surroundings.  They suffered no ill effects, only benefits, from the Advantage.  I benefited greatly by only spending $31.50 on Advantage that would treat all of my pets (4) for 4 months (plus 2 large pets for another month OR the dog for two more months, who is really the one who needs protection since he goes potty outside).

The vast majority of the bad reviews I have read here, are obviously (to me) from people who really do not understand where fleas come from and what you have to do to eliminate them.Here's the thing: 90% of the flea population that feeds off of your pet are NOT ON THE ANIMAL RIGHT NOW. That's right, the vast majority of the pests are actually on your floors, carpets, furniture, pet beds and so forth - waiting to hop on Spike and Fluffy when they are hungry. Fleas feed, then jump off the animal, while some more of their family jump on and start feeding in their place. To truly manage the flea problem requires TREATING THE ANIMAL AND THE PREMISES. If you do not treat the premises (including the yard) you will never get ahead of the problem. Sevin dust in the yard or some pyrethrin-based spray have been effective for me for many many years.Also, the lack of effectiveness that people think they are seeing is not because the product is not as good, it is because the fleas have become tougher over the years. You just have to attack the problem on all fronts and be as persistent as the pests themselves. Treat the animals and the premises and don't let up.Now, I am going to save some people a lot of money. The drug in Advantage for Dogs and Advantage for Cats is exactly the same drug (Imidacloprid) at the same concentration.If you buy this \"Large Dog\" package, you get four 4ml tubes. If you then empty those into a vial or vials, you can use a syringe (without needle) to apply the right dosage to your dogs AND cats. In fact, if your cats are under 10 pounds, you can get 10 cat doses out of each of these vials. That's a real bargain!Advantage II is the same, but adds Pyriproxyfen for the full life cycle coverage.Use the following chart and you will be fine.Cats up to 9 pounds - 0.4mlCats 10+ pounds - 0.8mlDogs 11-20 pounds - 1.0mlDogs 21-55 pounds - 2.5mlDogs 55+ pounds - 4.0ml", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Product is brilliant - people who buy it and write bad reviews, not so much!", "unixReviewTime": 1343260800, "reviewTime": "07 26, 2012"}

So if you have some stains so tough that absolutely nothing seems to get them out, this one might not work miracles.

Terrific little gadget for making playtime fun for you and your dog.  Be sure to get the appropriate size for your dog's mouth.  This comes in several sizes.

You see, my husband is an avid hunter and although we did not buy the dog only for hunting - we wanted a family dog that can go like we do - we had hoped that one way we could get him exercised would be through retrieving. We attempted to begin the awakening of genetics early (the day we brought him home). However, we have children, and although we warned them many times and watched the dog training videos together, as a family, on a loop for days - they thought playing chase and tag with him was a load of fun (which, lets be honest, it is)! Needless to say, he would chase the ball, BUT good luck getting him to bring it back! After the children realized what they had actually done - they vowed no more chase with balls...and we have attempted to begin the training over again. A couple of months ago I started working with him with a Kong ball - the red one. He would retrieve for a little bit - 5 or so throws and then start messing around. I read and watched more videos and worked/played more with him...but he would lose interest, and I had a SLIMEY hand - gross. So, when I saw the Chuck-it and it was on sale - I bought it. I thought at least my hand would not be so icky. It was L-o-V-e at first throw for this guy! He is absolutely obsessed! We bought the rubber balls as he is an avid chewer and would destroy a tennis ball in 2 seconds flat - and the rest is history. I don't think the only reason he is retrieving now is due only to the Chuck-It being so awesome, although it is pretty great. We really worked with him.

Measured the average throw today; it was 273 feet.  The dog caught the ball on the roll, otherwise it would've rolled farther.  Admittedly, this was with the wind, but 273 feet is incredible.  Using a standard pressure-less ball, presumably the Chuck-it ball would go farther.  This extra throw-distance appears to be mostly from the thinner and smoother arm.  Less wind resistance.The thinner arm does feel a little more flexible, but it's still very controllable.  It's easy to place the throw exactly where one wants.The Pro version is about an inch shorter than the 26M, which may not matter to most folks, but it means an extra inch bending over.  An inch won't matter to most, but if one has a bad back and a dog that insists on fifty or more tosses per session, it adds up.  Nevertheless, the dog gets a better workout and the Pro version is worth the extra few bucks.The handle is much more comfortable too.  Rubberized and form-fitting.

Also, it doesn't pick up as much dirt, so it stays cleaner too.  This was a problem I saw with my dog because the regular tennis balls collected so much dirt that she would accidentally swallow some as she was fetching and then end up dry heaving later that night.....I also suggest getting the pro version of chuck it because the handle is soooo much better that its worth the extra money.Caution though...if you throw it to far and your dog isnt paying attention or isnt quick enough to find it before it stops bouncing...you will be walking a long way to find the ball for them...especially if you paid extra money for the nicer chuckit ultra balls.  Luckily my dog is OCD and has to have the first ball we throw, so if she misses it she searches for it for at least 10  min before giving up.Oh and the Chuckit works ok with regular tennis balls, but it is sized just a bit smaller than a tennis ball size.

The best way to lob a ball a goodly distance is to NOT insert the ball all the way into the head.

Pretend you are a kid again and swing your arm like a windmill.  Just stop the motion when your arm is pointing straight towards the heavens.  The ball will launch at least 50-80 feet in an arch.  Great invention and I love it and my dog loves it.

If you don't use this every day and always have it turned on, this becomes a major hassle.The ice packs sort of work, but didn't keep the food particularly cold, freezing the food worked much better. They are very thin plastic that you fill with water, and I have a feeling the continual expanding of the ice will eventually break them.After a month I was so sick of trying to get this going at the correct times that I ditched it for the &#34;PetSafe 5-Meal Electronic Pet Feeder&#34;. It is much better.I will say though, if you make the necessary modifications (see the pictures I added to the product), this feeder is impossible to break into.

I planned to post a review of this product in about a month, but had to post this early in case it helped someone else in our situation with their dog.  So here is/was our situation.  Out of the blue one day while on vacation, my dog screamed in pain when walking up the 3 steps to our motorhome.  It was so heartbreaking and she ended up at a pet ER while we were traveling.  She was put on pain medication until we returned home.  After many unsuccessful vet visits,  it was determined by a specialist that our beagle has luxating patellas (kneecaps that pop out of joint).  She would always walk fine on level ground where no steps were involved.  So we had been carrying her inside her metal crate up and down our outside deck steps so she could do her thing!  A 25 lb. beagle AND a metal crate that has to weigh at least 15 lbs conservatively!  This had been going on since this past May when she experienced her first incident of obvious pain when going up steps.  I looked and researched many ramps, but this one was the only one made with a rubbery surface, although I think the entire ramp is some sort of plastic, but with incredibly good traction.  I did what another reviewer suggested, laid it flat on the floor inside of the house and within a day, with some coaxing and food, she easily walked back and forth over it that way.  Well, today, I decided to put it outside on the steps down to our patio, and didn't think she'd take to going down the ramp, much less up the ramp, right away.  Once again, food did the trick!  She didn't even hesitate, and walked down the ramp to retrieve the food, and back up again to retrieve the food, as my husband stood at one end, and I the other.  So in less than a week, she has really taken to it much more quickly than I expected.  So if anyone is on the fence about it, I highly recommend it, and the weather probably won't hurt it since it's made of hard plastic and rubber.  It has one little latch to fold it shut, but I just carry it sideways folded under my arm like a suitcase to move it if needed.

Since they are prone to all types of joint issues, I thought I would start early trying to protect him. Diesel is 8.5 months old. I have a Dodge Diesel 2500 pick up and they are quite tall. Diesel never wanted to go in by himself so that would leave me to hoist his large 80lb butt into the truck. Then after jumping down he would sometimes limp and was always very nervous about jumping out. So this ramp fixed all that. After receiving it I set it up into the truck and called him into the garage. He looked at it, grinned at me and up he went,then down,then up...you get the picture. I know this is not the correct way to train, but when Diesel's in the mood he catches on real quick. He loves rides so he is always impatient for me to set it up so he can get in the truck. But he does manage to wait with great distress. He climbs quickly up the ramp and I am happy that it has a non-slip surface that is permanent not stuck on, and the sides remind him not to step off. It fits ok on the lip of the underneath part of my truck seats if the seats are in the upright position. It's tight but it fits. This thing is heavy when you are trying to unfold it and hold onto a large puppy. The weight is the only downfall, but it's also what makes this sturdy and built so well.

It didn't work with my car, so I can't attest to using it for that purpose.Cons, first:-It's not really wide enough for a large dog with an unsteady gait (unless guided very carefully).  However, if you are a DIY'er and are placing this in one stationary spot, you could likely attach boards along the sides to prevent falling.  We had a few scary moments with this ramp because of the width and low sides.-The ridges are deep (deep enough that they really do prevent the dog from sliding down, but also made it uncomfortable for my dog to go up, as very uneven surfaces are hard for him to maneuver).  Wish the ridges were a bit more shallow, as the non-slip surface seems powerful on its own.-No bottom supports (not an issue for small dogs, but for larger dogs, the fact that there are no supports and is hinged in the middle means that there is some give when the dog walks on it - this made my dog a little nervous, but not enough that it would prevent me from purchasing it).  This is more of a FYI than a con.-I left mine in one spot, so this was irrelevant for me, but it is fairly heavy (this coming from a small-framed woman).Pros:-The rubber feet at the top seemed to hold well.-Folds for storage and transporting.-The rubberized non-slip surface is awesome!!!  I used it during the winter (and even regularly heated water in a tea kettle to pour over the surface for melting snow/ice) and it performed wonderfully.-This is superficial, but I love that it is khaki-colored, as it blended in better with my concrete steps and was less obvious than darker colored ones.Eventually I ended up building my own custom ramp, only because the ridges on this ramp were too deep for my dog.

She's only thirty-five pounds but she goes through most toys like they're bubblegum. Even as a small puppy, she would destroy anything and everything. By the age of five or six months we had to give up on soft and rope toys altogether, and at a year old, she is limited to only hard chews like Kong, Nylabone, etc. Even then, she destroys most of these with relative ease. She's gone through chews others have recommended as long-lasting in literally ten minutes. The only toy she has that has lasted more than a month or so is her original red Kong, which she mostly licks instead of chews.I initially bought the dinosaur for my other, less toy-murderous dog, but the power chewer quickly stole it from him. She was in love. She carried it everywhere and chewed on it constantly. I'm not sure if it's the shape or the texture she likes, or some combination thereof, but whatever the case, it instantly became her favorite. Even the most durable hard toys normally only last a few weeks with her, but her dino is going on two or three months now. It's chewed beyond recognition, all the nubs worn down, and it's very rapidly nearing the end of its life because little bits of plastic are falling off, but it still lasted far longer than most toys do. A few weeks ago I bought her a second one, in a different shape, and she's equally as enamored with it.

Kaczmarek", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I have three dogs in my household, two &#60;25 pounds and one that is &#62;120 pounds so it's difficult to find chew toys they can all share. I did read through the reviews prior to purchasing and was a little worried about my large dog breaking teeth and having dental problems as a results of this toy, however, I bought it anyways because he is not much of a real &#34;chewer&#34;. He's used to sharing his housemates toys and instead of chewing (and destroying the toys in one crunch), has learned to gently roll the toys around in his mouth and gently teethe on them. When the toy arrived, the large dog did his usual... only creating a few noticeable dents in the toy. The toy is, as previously mentioned by others, VERY hard that I'm surprised dogs even like to chew it. One time while the large dog was chewing it I did notice traces of blood on the toy and after a visual mouth inspection, concluded that he scraped his tongue. The smaller dogs have done more damage to this chew toy to the point where there are many jagged, sharp edges where they continue to chew. Any mark that is made into the toy creates these sharp edges and then hair/lint/carpet gets caught in it. If you have occasional chewers, this wouldn't be a bad purchase. If you have regular, or aggressive chewers though, I would not recommend this toy. It would not last long and I would worry about small, sharp pieces breaking off and being ingested.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Gets unsightly fast.", "unixReviewTime": 1378080000, "reviewTime": "09 2, 2013"}

We got the stegosaurus toy and so far, it's held up. She's a ferocious chewer--we can't buy her anything but Nylabone-type toys or they immediately get torn to bits. The only problem I foresee is that the stegosaurus has four legs sticking off of the body, and I know those are going to get worn down very quickly as she can fit that whole part in her mouth at once, meaning she can't play with this unless we're there to see her least she chew off a leg and choke on it. It would've been nice to be able to have seen this variety and choose which one we wanted prior to ordering. I was thinking we would get the T-Rex pictured, which only has two feet that seem to be attached to the tail. The good news is, steggie doesn't have a small projectile head or tail, but rather it curves to give the impression of head and tail, so no worries about small pieces coming off there. The toy itself I would probably give 3.5 or 4 stars, but I am only giving it an overall 3 because the ordering process is inflexible.UPDATE: I have lowered my rating to 2 stars. She has had this less than 5 months and I had to take it away from her after she managed to chew away the legs, tail, head, and half the body.

He has the same reaction to the bacon-flavored hollow stick.Before buying, know your dog's chewing style; not just based on breeds, but your actual pet. I have done a fair amount of research online, reading reviews, and talking to pet store clerks to find out this is not an uncommon behavior. Teething puppies are figuring out the world and will put anything in their mouth but may prefer a hard surface to push their teeth against into their gums. Then, with adult teeth, they may want to use their powerful teeth to destroy. So, this toy will likely fail to redirect destructive behavior because they will not be able to cause any damage. My dog quickly lost interest and started gnawing on his previously ignored teething bone, which I had to quickly take away after two days. He got one good day out of the teething bone, exposing the dental bristles, but was breaking off much larger pieces on day two and would have destroyed the whole thing in under and hour if I had not separated him from it. Now, I am stuck with two durachews and not quite sure how to spark his interest in either.Pro: Teething puppy looking for hard surfaceCon: Useless for powerful chewer that cannot dent", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Waste of Money if your Dog like to Destroy", "unixReviewTime": 1395014400, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2014"}

Perfect!\" Add to that the fact that I love dinosaurs and this was a must.At a checkup for my cats before the dog came home I talked to my vet about some of the concerns with the new puppy, and her recommendations for good chew toys. She warned us against the white Nylabone toys specifically. She didn't want our dog to have anything harder than a tooth to chew on (including bones and hard plastic toys like this) because of the potential to crack his teeth. Even though he's a puppy, she was concerned about the possibility of infection and abscess in a cracked tooth and the dangers of putting a puppy under for oral surgery to extract the cracked tooth/teeth. I'm glad she did warn me because I never would have known.As soon as we got back from the appointment I returned it and Amazon gave me a refund no problem (five stars for the customer service there), so that was good. In retrospect, I can see she was right. If nothing else I could have kept the toy to beat up any intruders in my apartment--it really is that hard.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Not safe for chewers--too hard", "unixReviewTime": 1359504000, "reviewTime": "01 30, 2013"}

Unlike many other supplements Nupro is manufactured here in the United States from first quality sources. Recent findings that  Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer.Who has sourced out the manufacturing of Pet-Tabs to India, along with the newly published report by Consumer labs that levels of lead approaching the toxic zone have been discovered.Nupro is based on a whole food concept. You very well could feed your dog nothing but Nupro and expect most nutritional needs to be met. However specific proteins and essential vitamins and trace minerals would be missed.I mention this only to re enforce that although Nupro isn't a replacement for a healthy diet - it can enhance what ever food you are currently feeding your pooch.As a dog lover who has never been without a dog or three for 50 plus years. I have been making my own dog food for over thirty.Long before the was an Internet I was teaching myself all I could about canine nutrition. My self education continues - and I remain highly suspect of any commercial dog food.Especially if you consider that out of literally thousands of brands and sub brands - there are a mere 14 considered safe and healthy. Since the founding of Nupro some 25 years ago there has never been a single instance of a recall, tainted ingredient or other unfortunate mishap.Using palatable desiccated (powdered) liver as a base Nupro adds the following:1) Kelp - rich in trace minerals and iodine Kelp is proven to improve glandular functions and provide  a rich source of natural vitamins A, B1, B2, C, and E.2) Amino Acids and Enzymes - proven to strengthen the immune system in dogs and humans.3) Flax Seed - Great source of Omega 3 Fats. Unlike fish oils no smell and what is more, no chance of mercury.4) Lecithin - long applauded for it's effect on brain, nerve and healthy liver function.5) Allicin (highly condensed garlic oil) Proven to fight cardiovascular disease. A powerhouse of anti oxidants.6) Lactobacillus Acidophilus - Helps regulate the digestive system, reduces gas, bloating and stomach upset. Can compliment the use of whole fat yogurt for those who use it.Nupro is in powdered form and does not need to be refrigerated. Over the past year, I have exchanged emails with founder and she is eager to answer any questions and support any claims with factual studies and information.My only real concern with Nupro is that I believe the initial dose recommendations are far too excessive.The company would benefit by adding label information addressed to those dogs with sensitive stomachs and or digestive problems.But common sense should prevail. Never overload a new ingredient to any dogs diet. Acclimation should be reduced to the smallest denominator.Rather than one large scoop (included) I would advise a teaspoon at most for dogs over 50 lbs and significantly less for smaller dogs. For finicky eaters Nupro can be mixed with a little warm water to make a gravy - and who doesn't like gravy?By adding Nupro to your dogs diet you can expect to see:1) Dramatic improvement in the coat. More shine and less shedding.2) Less stomach upset3) Firmer stools4) Higher balanced behavior and more energy5) Improved breathNupro is an excellent time proven product.Used conservatively in the beginning both you and your beloved pooch and or pooches should experience an overall improvement in many areas of your dogs overall health and well being.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sensational Whole Food Based Supplement", "unixReviewTime": 1336348800, "reviewTime": "05 7, 2012"}

I guess the most astonishing thing we've seen is this:  Georgia is a 15 year old cocker mix who had become pitiful looking.  First of all, she was covered in these wart like things---literally covered.  The vet would express some of them, but nothing took them away.  She is my sisters dog and I would not even touch her because the warts grossed me out.  Secondly, she had lost so much oh her hair that we called her baboon butt and her tail looked like the Grinches Christmas tree.  Seriously, you could hold it up and it had a few scraggly hairs hanging off a bald tail.  Thirdly, she was very gray.  So, I had not seen Georgia in about a month and when she walked in I thought my sister had a new dog.  Georgia's is now a luscious, glossy black ( except for her face) her fur is thick, soft and her tail  fur is completely full.  It truly is mind blowing and I would not have believed it had I not seen it.  Her warts are almost completely gone and she has so much energy.  I swear her eyesight and hearing are better but my sis does not agree with that.  As far as my 9 year old Lily- she acts like a 2 year old now.  My sisters other 2 dogs have the softest, silkiest fur you have ever seen and are the picture of health.  Just started my moms buddy on this and sending some home with my brother for his Romeo.  If I could but stock in this company I would.  Oh-  in terms of Lily's plaque?  Gone, period.  And I could not even break it off with a scraper.

He would struggle a bit to get up after lying down for a while and would typically showcase a light limp for the first few minutes after standing.  After monitoring him for about two weeks to make sure it wasn't a mild sprain and seeing the condition neither improve or get worse, I started him on both this Nupro supplement andVetri-Science Laboratories Methylsulfonylmethane 250 Supplement for Dogs, 120 Count.  After a couple of weeks, I noticed a marked improvement in my Boxer.  He no longer struggled at all to get up and the limp was entirely gone.  Since I began giving him both supplements, I've only seen him limp twice after waking up, and both times were after naps following particularly strenuous play sessions at the local dog park.I can't say for certain whether it was the Nupro, the Methylsulfonylmethane, or the combination of the two that did the trick, but I can say that my dog no longer shows any signs of suffering from hip dysplasia at all.As another note, both of my dogs absolutely love Nupro.  My Boxer would occasionally skip meals before I started him on this supplement, but since I did he has only skipped one, and that was on a day when he had an upset stomach.  The same goes for my German Shepherd.  They both vigorously chow down every meal now.  So I suppose Nupro could also work if you have difficulty getting your dog to put on weight.  To avoid a mess, I typically put the Nupro in their food, then add water and shake.

She has grain allergies, so we keep her on a very strict diet and it helps dramatically, but every once in a while, after swimming and drinking excess water, she'd have a little leakage.  Not a drop since she's been on these supplements. She did have am odd reaction to the MSM (I think) when I first started her on it.  Her hind legs got a rash and were really itchy after a couple days, so I stopped for a week, and started her back on very gradually when the rash subsided.

But I guess this is a trade off for a durable bone when it isn't a rubbery material.So, overall we are happy with the bone. Our dog loves it (a little too much when we find it in our bed) and it has lasted a while. We'll probably buy another one when it's gone.

Cats are carnivores. However, commercial pet food companies load their pet foods with grains, especially corn because it's cheap, and it isn't digestible for cats. I also learned about everything else in commercial pet foods, including euthanized pets!! How disgusting! I researched grain-free cat foods and learned of the Wellness brand of grain-free pet foods, and ordered a case of canned food. The results were almost immediate! After just a couple of days on the Wellness canned food, my cake no longer has diarrhea and it has never reoccurred. On top of that, he loves the Wellness food, so I highly recommend this food for all cat owners.

So I wanted to switch from Tidy Cats which I found to be too dusty and has this weird deoderizer smell which progressively becomes less pleasant the longer it stays out. Having a limited variety to choose from, I picked up World's Best. BIG mistake. Honestly, it's not as though I was expecting this to be the best, but ironically it's probably among the worst. I understand all the hype about all natural products, but using corn as litter is probably the dumbest idea. When I opened the bag, I didn't expect that it it would smell exactly like grain. I wondered how something that smelled like that could possibly neutralize urine and feces odors, but since this product is priced higher than the rest and is obviously selling, I decided to ignore my skepticism. It has not even been 24 hours since I purchased this and I am absolutely outraged that this company has the nerve to sell an 8 lb bag for close to $10 and claim to be the world's best litter, when their product is complete trash.Here's everything that is wrong with this litter:-It smells like grain out of the bag and just smelled like grain mixed with feces and urine after my cat used it. I don't know how this has any positive reviews, but I noticed that some positive ones express that those who have issues with it probably have cats with very stinky excrement. Well, my cat is a tiny kitten whose poop is NOT overly stinky because she is fed the best quality food I can find. I just dumped all the litter into the trash, because seeing how it smells, I know my cat will stop using the box if it stays in there any longer. Cats are like that.-Many people expressed that this litter breaks down into a fine powder after some time. I already noticed that powder forming along the bottom of the box. This means DUST, which I'm guessing is the reason she had stopped burying her waste with the Tidy Cats. Plus she was sneezing all the time. That being said, in terms of odor, Tidy Cats is still a far better product and less expensive than this one.-This is perhaps the WORST part: When I placed my cat into the litter box after adding this litter to introduce her to it, she sniffed for a couple of minutes and I was horrified when she ATE a few grains. She was confused and thought it was FOOD! I can imagine how ludicrous it must have seemed to her to have to poop and pee in food. After I read another review about someone else's cat eating it, I gave up on the idea of using it up by mixing it with the new litter I bought (Precious Cat which sells a much higher rated 18 lb bag for almost the same price this one sells an 8 lb bag for).That being said, if I can't stand the smell of this litter, I'm fairly certain my cat can't. The main reason cats stop using their litter boxes is because of odor issues. I pay extra for odor control and if, after cleaning the box twice a day as I usually do, I still have to deal with odor issues, then this stuff is clearly a huge waste of money. So far I can't say much about the Precious Cat, which I immediately went out and purchased to replace this one, other than the fact that when I opened the bag, I didn't smell any funny odor or experience a puff of dust, and when I put my cat into the box she sniffed a bit and walked out as though there was nothing unusual worth investigating. If you can get to a Pet Supplies Plus or Petco, I'd probably buy that one as it's only a bit more expensive than Tidy Cats and probably WAY better (I'll soon find out). But the bottom line is, I would use ANY litter over this one.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Quite the misnomer", "unixReviewTime": 1312761600, "reviewTime": "08 8, 2011"}

I've been through a half dozen or so varieties in the five years I've had him and while I've yet to find the \"purrfect\" litter, this one is pretty good except for the tracking.So prior to this brand, I was usingKitty's Crumble All Natural Coconut Husk Cat Litter, 14 lb, which worked really well, until Amazon decided to jack the price up and make it unaffordable. This litter had good reviews and, as of this review, is roughly the same price as Kitty's Crumble used to be here, so I decided to try this out.The 15 pound bag has a nice plastic handle to it and a zip tear opening. The 20 pound bag doesn't have a handle, nor a zip tear opening. Inside is just cedar, ground up into very light and circular amounts. It's like pouring out a bag of sand, only it's cedar. It has a nice smell to it, is extremely soft and I don't notice any odor. When Garfunkel urinates in it, it doesn't clump and that section turns into a darker, maroon-type color until it dries up. Since he tends to go all the way in the back of the box in the same spot, by the end of the week I notice slight amounts of liquid residue at the bottom of the litter box when I'm emptying it, but even then, all the litter above it has returned to its normal \"dry\" color and isn't maroon like it was just used.I have a big litter box and just like with the Kitty's Crumble I use half a bag of this each week, scooping out the poo daily and dumping it all and using another half of the bag from scratch. Works well.The only real problem, as the review title says, is that this tracks like crazy. I live in a studio apartment and within a day you can see the cedar all over my carpet and kitchen linoleum. Also, if I'm in bed and Garfunkel is doing his business, after he rockets out of the box and jumps onto the bed with me the litter gets all over the sheets. He does have fur tufts on his feet though, so they tend to get trapped in there.This litter would probably be perfect if it didn't track so much. Otherwise, this is a winner.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Tracks like crazy, but Garfunkel seems to like it...", "unixReviewTime": 1332115200, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2012"}

I have noticed (sorry if this is TMI) that they urinate, not defecate, in the cedar boxes and use the traditional box and litter for the other...not complaining!One difference is that you end up pretty much changing out the litter completely when you deal with the box- for me, every 2 to 3 days.

I tried World's best cat litter, which is basically just toasted cracked corn, and it worked quite well, even in my automatic litter box.  However, it's expensive - about [...] a pound.  You end up spending close to [...] a month for litter for two cats.So when I saw Swheat Scoop for about half the price I thought I'd try it.  It was similar to World's Best in that it's made from wheat so it's flushable and natural.  Only problem is it works horribly in the automatic box, although they claim it can be used there.  The cat's liquid waste turns the litter into a pasty, sticky gob that sticks to the litter box bottom and/or to the rakes when they come by to clean the box.  It simply isn't worth the price savings if you want a natural cat litter, at least if you have an automatic box.

Unlike clumping clay litters, this is safe to use with kittens.  Yes, there are other clumping litters out there that are also safe for use with kittens, but Swheat Scoop seems to be the least expensive.  I was impressed with how very, very little dust this litter contains.  It's unscented, which I suppose is really a matter of personal preference, but a major plus for those with sensitive noses.  The downside: it doesn't clump quite as tightly as clumping clay litters, but when you've got kittens, it's better than no clumping at all!  And yes, it also does track more than clay litters.  As for forming hard-to-remove globs on the sides and bottoms of the box, I scoop our box daily (we have 4 three-month-old kittens) and haven't experienced any such problems.  Maybe it's because I clean the litterbox so often, maybe it's because a kitten's tiny bladder can't possibly hold that much fluid, but whatever the reason, scooping daily with 4 kittens, I haven't had to chisel any hardened globs from the sides or bottom of the box.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for kittens!", "unixReviewTime": 1215388800, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2008"}

Neither are vigorous diggers, there are two large litter pans side by side. Neither cat is fussy about litter type.Pluses:-- flushable (my top reason for use, I don't have trash service)-- acceptable clumping (but I have never used the clay litters to compare)-- non toxic & no lung choking perfumes (I am bothered by potent odors)Minuses:-- cost-- to eliminate odor you must add an additional product-- for best results you have to clean box daily-- cost (it's a byproduct of wheat production that is likely swept up off a factory floor somewhere, wrapped in a fancy brand name and sold at TOP DOLLAR)Notes & Suggestions:-- I have found that the urine sinks to the bottom and sticks there. If I tip the box so the dry litter is out of the way, then I can scoop out just the clumped litter and any granules that break off. This helps to reduce odor.-- Every time after I scoop the box, I sprinkle baking soda over the top. I find that it sticks to the pee soaked clumps, so it must be replenished.-- I don't put new litter in every time... instead I let the level get lower and lower. Then at the end of the week, I completely dispose of everything in the box, wash the box with diluted bleach and soap, refill with fresh litter.-- Without baking soda, this stuff does small like warm bread that's been peed on... I can't imagine what the corn based stuff must smell like?! I have smelled corn based products (cat food, corn gluten fertilizer, chicken food & chicken poop which smells identical BTW, etc..) and they are revolting to me. Personal preference.-- I pour my bags right into a galvanized, sealed can. I have not had any problems with insects. Although I can imagine that it would easily be an issue if it is not kept in a sealed container.-- I did find evidence of a mouse getting into the litter box. I dealt with him, and do not have any mouse issues in my house. If you already battle with these creatures, it could be a concern.-- If I leave the box more than two days without cleaning, I do experience the gooey state of clumping. This litter was a COMPLETE bust at my sister's house. She has 4 cats, 2 boxes and doesn't like to clean on a daily basis.POSSIBLE CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE:--Today, when I picked up a new bag, and was griping about the cost and how cheap I am, the clerk at the feed store mentioned a cheaper alternative. Apparently they have a customer that buys chicken food, and uses that in her boxes. It's a grain based crumble that effectively works the same. The most compelling part being that 50# costs about $16.00, give or take. I got home, looked it up online and there are threads about how it works. I think I'll try that out next time.UPDATE, 3/21/2013:I tried the chicken food. It works the same. Zero difference in effectiveness and odor. Have found granules of \"litter\" that were in the cracks of the hardwood that were moth eaten...like those moths that get into flour. Chicken food is loads cheaper! I have more cats now, and other options besides flushing for disposal. I have switched litter completely. With the number of boxes that I now require, the insect and rodent draw is too much. Two boxes was fine, but with more it's like a buffet for pests, even with diligent cleaning.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pluses & Minuses.....", "unixReviewTime": 1312934400, "reviewTime": "08 10, 2011"}

Bad news folks, it's mostly all some kind of filler like corn, wheat, and ground up chicken bits that don't really qualify as meat.  You ever wonder why your dog is so fat?  He's addicted to the carb filler in his dog food just like you are addicted to cherry pie and those great breadsticks at olive garden!  I'm not going to go into a big description of how the glycemic index works, but all those carbs and lack of nutrition in his cheap dog fog make him eat more and get fat.  You&#8217;ll notice the serving size on really expensive dog food is much lower because there is actually meat in there and no filler.  Even everyone&#8217;s favorite Science Diet has a heck of a lot of filler in it.  I recommend Diamond Naturals because this is the cheapest no filler dog food that you are likely to find.

It's not the best, but it's good enough and I'll likely keep buying it.Diamond is a large manufacturer. They make Natural Balance brand food, which is good and what I used to use. Comparing Diamond brand vs. Diamond-made Natural Balance brand there are two main differences:Diamond is a larger bag for much cheaper.Natural Balance uses primarily Chicken, and then Lamb and Duck Meal. Diamond uses Beef Meal.So both use meal, but Diamond uses more/only meal. Is there a big difference? Probably not. Meal just means it's cooked and ground up. Most sources seem to agree that meal is not necessarily any worse than plain meat. What is bad is \"by product\", and neither food has this. Also bad are fillers like corn, which neither food has, either.I tried Diamond when I couldn't get Natural Balance on Prime and I needed dog food. The (substantially) lower price did not hurt. I knew it wouldn't be as good quality, but figured it would be good enough.One dog was fine with the Diamond. The other had seriously bad \"problems\" on and off for about 3 weeks. In fairness, he doesn't do well with any diet changes and had been eating Natural Balance for 9 years straight. I believe the issues were not because of the Diamond, but because of a change. Meaning I could have bought the best food on earth, and I think he still would have had issues. If this changes and he develops problems again, I will assume it is the food and will update the review.Now that both dogs are fine with this food, I will probably stick with it. It's cheap, easy to get, and the quality is good. If I have issues, I will switch back to Natural Balance, but for now I don't see a point in paying more for rather similar food.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Perfect? No. Keep buying? Yes.

I even put it in a separate room away from their food so they would stop dropping their food in the bowl. But because paws still like to go in the water it still needs cleaned once a week and I dreaded doing it. If purchasing I would invest in some pipe cleaners because there are some hard-to-reach places - including the reservoir.Filters: For 2 cats a filter would last about a month, if I rinsed it when I cleaned the fountain. And when the filter becomes dirty all the carbon chunks sink to the bottom of the filter impeding on the water flow making it weak. I wasn't impressed with filter ability as I expected it to actually filter. Filters run about $6.99 for a two pack.This sounds like less than a 4 star review but after 2 years of buying filters and cleaning the fountain every week a lightbulb finally went off in my head.I ran out of filters and couldn't get to the store for a few days so I just cleaned and refilled the fountain without the filter. Genius! The water flow stayed strong and since the flow was circulating faster and stronger it keeps the fountain cleaner longer. And since I got rid of the filters I've been having to fill the reservoir more probably because my cats drink from it more due to the stronger current.So I would recommend this fountain to my friends and tell them to eliminate the filters but still keep an eye on the fountain for cleanliness.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "My Cats Love It", "unixReviewTime": 1240099200, "reviewTime": "04 19, 2009"}

They have two fountains at my house.PROS:1. The cats drink more water because they seem to be attracted to the flowing aspect of the water.  Additional water consumption is good for cats and people.2. Since the water is filtered it is fresher and cleaner than a bowl of water.CONS:1. There are little crevices that are very difficult to clean.  I have resorted to using a steam cleaner to thoroughly clean the fountain once a week.  On a daily basis I use a small brush and mild dish soap.  Then I allow the fountain to thoroughly dry to eliminate any bacteria that were not removed with soap and water before refilling with water.2. Because the sides are low one of my felines manages to splash significant quantities of water out of the bowl as he drinks leaving a little river on the floor.  I have found that placing the fountain in a half sheet pan solves this problem but gives me something else to clean.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:1. I have not had any difficulty with algae in the bowl or feline acne.  This may to due to my fastidious cleaning routine.2. I have also not had any problems with pumps malfunctioning.  But I do take the fountains apart completely every day and clean them, including the pump intakes.3. I change the filter every month, just as I do for our household water filter.  No sense in risking bacterial growth for a less than $2 a filter.In summation I enjoy this product, because the felines enjoy it.

The new Drinkwell has been wonderful because I've definitely seen all three of my cats drinking MUCH more water in the last two weeks than with the Petmate fountain.  I can promise you I've found the proof in the litter boxes.The Drinkwell's water stream is much stronger and circulates the water better than the Petmate. It gives the water the power to move most of the debris toward the little trap.  That keeps the water bowl so much cleaner; where as with the Petmate, the debris would circulate until it either sank to the bottom or stuck to the bowl walls.  In addition, the Drinkwell's filter is designed SO much better (6 divided coal sections).  The coal in the Petmate's filter would just clump at the bottom (i believe it has 2 divided sections).The Drinkwell also holds a lot more water. Both products are dishwasher safe, so regular washing is easy for either. However, I can say the old Petmate has many tiny corners which made it a pain when it came to scrubbing off the mineral deposit build up (but my guess is the new one will be too).I would recommend paying the extra $20 and going for the Drinkwell Platinum and staying away from this old model.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "The Drinkwell Platinum is much better and cleaner product", "unixReviewTime": 1225324800, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2008"}

I have two units in my house, one at either end of the house.My cat drinks from the top of the water run and my dog slurps from the bowl (dog backwash has got to be worse than cat backwash!).  Yes, I do dig out dog and cat hair from the intake/lever area about once a week, but that's a small task compared to washing and filling a couple of water bowls each day or worse yet, forgetting to fill a bowl or finding one completely empty and wondering \"how long have they gone without water\"? The pumps make enough \"noise\" when the water levels get too low, thus it's nearly impossible to allow a pump to burn out (nearly, not completely!).There is no \"slimy\" feeling to the bowl like there is in a standard water bowl (you know that \"film\" one often feels when cleaning a regular water bowl, despite the fact it looks clean?) and the large reservoir ensures plenty of water all the time (although I do keep a 1/2 gallon container nearby each one so I can just fill and dump directly into the basin instead of pulling out the reservoir to refill - I do the latter frequently, but at times I'm in a rush and a quick refill via the extra container does the trick for me.Lastly, my veterinarian noted my cat of 7.5lb cat  of 18.5 years lived as long as she did, despite being a tiny runt who had been severely malnourished and abandoned when I found her up for adoption at about 1 year of age, because he found cats drink far more frequently with these units which, in turn, keeps their kidneys filtering properly and, in turn, keeps the kidneys working well overall - kidney woes often being the fatal ailment of cats.The dog?  Well, for whatever reason, she simply will not drink out of puddles or the odd bucket or container - could be a lucky coincidence, but I can't help but suspect she's only known \"fresh water\" from the likes of this system and that's her preference - no icky puddle water ingested means less of a chance of parasites or similar.UPDATE 5/29/10 - I had read others complaining the units leak (other sites mostly) and alas, I am now among the growing cluster o' complainers.  Late the other night I heard popping sounds and much to my dismay (and total disgust) I found the unit had been leaking (probably about 3 days or so) profusely the entire contents (probably two full systems' worth) had soaked through the carpet and had severely buckled the original hardwood flooring to such an extent two planks are nearly buckled onto their sides (hence the popping sounds I believe). I had \"assumed\" the dog and cat were simply drinking more because the weather was changing and didn't realize there was substantial leak (never saw it, never felt it, but then I usually have shoes on) - looking back, I had noticed a very loud \"water fall\" sound had started with the unit (which some may like, but I found it annoying) and I discovered the section that fits atop the pump had a small split in it.  I didn't worry about it as it just meant that only 1/2 of the water was making its way up to the \"ramp\", but I should have inspected the unit more carefully as I would have likely noticed signs of the major external leak that was probably developing (although to look at the unit, empty as it is now, it's not like there's some gaping hole or visible crack in the base).Equally frustrating is the company's customer service option - no email, no contact via a Web site, only snail mail and a M-F phone bank that's routinely busy.  I've been a big fan of these units for many years, but given I'm not the first person to whine about major leaking problems, I fear the company is either cutting corners or is using defective/inferior parts.  The damage to the carpet is substantial - I had no idea mold would/could grow under a carpet in just a few days - but then I don't have experience with leaving a few gallons of water on it - the carpet can be replaced, not that I really have a choice now - but the hardwood is another story, as fate would have it, I found, \"they no longer make the plank sizes\", it's custom hardwood time - oh brother.  Until the company steps up and addresses the increasing leaking complaints, I hate to have to say it, but stay away from buying this model (or if you have a unit now, place it on a plastic tray or similar).

The point of having them is to provide running water, which cats like. Most complaints are about cleaning and noise. Cleaning is indeed necessary, much more often if you have more than one cat, and when new the parts are difficult to take apart. A little rocking of the top when taking the top off helps when new and eases with use. The bowl should be scrubbed with a mesh scrubber and a bottle brush helps get into tubes and corners. A rinse with diluted vinegar reduces lime scaling. Cleaning the pump is quick, easy and necessary. See felinediabetes.com/petmate_freshflow_cleaning.htm for excellent instructions and don't skip cleaning the impeller. Reduced flow is caused by either a dirty pump, which shortens its life, or a dirty filter. A clogged filter can also cause an overflow. Noise can be caused by not seating the pump carefully on the floor of the bowl after cleaning, but a rattling noise is just a sign of low water level. The pump is lubricated with water. If it runs dry it will burn up quickly. Just as with a plain bowl, water should be added every day. The reservoir should not be needed; it is a very temporary backup. This is just a machine, and it does take routine maintenance, but given that it will perform well for years. I keep a spare pump on hand; like everything, including us, it will eventually wear out, but replacing it essentially restores the Petmate to new condition.

Our vet recommended a fountain after Fiona, as a kittten, was plagued with a UTI and some related issues.  The price of the fountain was reasonable.  After spending over $1,000 on vet bills we decided that it was worth it to take a chance on the fountain.  Fiona and Ginger took to it immediately.  For weeks, Noodles, the oldest, would stare at it for long periods of time, and then go to the old bowl.  After watching how the other two use the fountain, she eventually became a convert.With three cats using it, the reservoir becomes nearly empty each day, but that's OK as we would replenish daily, anyhow.  It would be a problem if we went away for a couple days and had no pet sitter.  Each day when I refill the water, I squirt a small amount of apple cider vinegar in the area just above the slide.  (Using one of the pet med syringes, I fill to the \"4\" mark -- not sure if it's ml or cc.)  I think it helps with their health, makes their coats shiny, etc.Total cleaning is a project, which I do weekly in the winter and more often in the summer.  In the summer, more hair and goo accumulates around the edge of the bowl and, more especially, at the pump.  My cleaning \"kit\" consists of an old toothbrush, Dawn detergent, a sponge makeup wedge, and tweezers.  There are corners in the back part of the bowl, expecially near the pump, that are hard to clean.  Occasionally, using an old Water Pic attachment, I flush out the inside of the pump.  The first time, loads of black gunk gushed out of the hole, and a lot had accumulated in other areas in the pump.  Because the pump is black, and the goo is black, it was easy to overlook its existence with a fast, normal cleaning.Best news:  Since buying the fountain there have been no more health issues (knock wood).We'd buy another one, but would most likely see what else is out there that cleans more easily, and holds more water to make it better for three cats.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It makes Noodles, Fiona and Ginger happy!", "unixReviewTime": 1292112000, "reviewTime": "12 12, 2010"}

The med. size released water to keep it at a level of \" below the rim, but this jumbo one doesn't add water until the level in the bowl drops to an inch below the rim... fairly minor difference.

The product worked well and my six cats used it without any problems. The pump worked fine as long as it was regularly cleaned. The major drawback was that the bowl and its various parts were difficult to clean and even more so for me since I have well water and the mineral build up was particularly hard to remove. Then last week the electrical cord actually separated from the pump at the point of entry into the pump itself. I have several small and large water fountains which use pumps and have never had this happen before. But the pump did have some age on it so I began to search for a replacement. The original pump was a Jebao model PP-333-LV. However, the same model is now a different size and lacks the flow control valve. I checked the Jebao website, the Petmate website and many, many other websites in an attempt to find a compatible pump. I was successful only in wasting my time and elevating my blood pressure. The construction of the compartment for the pump is such that you must have the exact same size or it just won't work. It has to fit perfectly. I noticed that others who had commented on the same problem cobbled together parts from their old pump along with a new one with satisfactory results. I decided against this route and began to research other pet water fountains. After reading the comments accompanying each it became apparent that each had its own problems.So I decided to make my own. All you need is an aquarium circulating filter (I used the Tetra Whisper PF10, about $14), a large glass, stainless steel or ceramic bowl and some glass pebbles (optional). I had a beautiful antique crockery bowl lined in blue ceramic that was just collecting dust (5\" deep by 9 1/4\" diameter)which was perfect for the project because it has a 3\" wide straight band around the top, like a clay flower pot, which holds the clip-on aquarium filter straight up without any shimming. A large straight sided glass salad bowl would also work beautifully. I added some polished glass beads in the bottom to catch the usual debris and it works like a charm - so easy to clean. Google \"make your own pet fountain\" for detailed instructions. And the best part, my cats love it.

Our vet also told us that cats drink less out of traditional bowls because their whiskers tend to hit the sides which is uncomfortable for them. The bowl of this fountain is wide enough to accommodate whiskers and therefore cats will tend to drink longer. After a day or so of being timid of the fountain, our cats took right to it. They are drinking probably four times the amount of water they used to drink from regular water bowls. The water trickling does make some noise, just enough to entice the cats and be soothing to nearby humans.

This goes away as soon as you refill the reservoir tank by removing the lid, pulling out the tank (which reminds me a bit of a gerbil waterer on steroids), unscrewing the cap, filling it up, then doing all this in reverse; a 30-second process.The gurgling happens every day, and I would rinse the unit every couple/few days, and completely wash the unit out once every two weeks.

This can be a challenge since cats can be notoriously finicky or even lazy about drinking enough water.With this in mind, as well as keeping more water available during my frequent travels, I tried out this unit, was pleased, and bought an additional one.  After about a year, one of them started to leak through the joint whre the water flows through.  I replaced the unit with a new one that has not leaked yet.I've had three cats use them.  One loves the water fountains  best and drinks from them pretty much exclusively; that senior kitty can't crouch very well so she drinks from the top of the flowing part, while standing up. Another cat alternates between normal bowls and the bowl of the fountains.  A third one never used the fountains.For the people complaining about noise or burned out units, keep in mind this product uses a submersible pump (like in an aquarium), it needs to be completely immersed to function properly and to cool itself.  Letting it run dry makes it both noisy and damages the pump (after a while).  Keep it filled and it's fine.  The fountain will be noisy for 1-5 minutes when you first re-fill it, but otherwise it's just a quiet hum.Caveats:  It's hard to tell when the filters are gunked up enough to affect the taste of the water, and replacing them creates some added cost.  If your animals shed a lot, fur can get stuck around the pump and eventually impede water flow.

She loves it so much that when it is time for routine cleaning of it, she meows at me the entire time I am working on it until she has her FreshFlow back.  I do not use this as a water filter though, as I have filtered water from my tap.Keep in mind that routine cleaning is necessary to keep the FreshFlow working.  Fur from the cat will clog the pump/motor, which will eventually burn out if not attended to.  I clean this out once per week to ensure it works properly.  I believe parts of this product is dishwasher safe, but unfortunately, I do not have a dishwasher, so I am forced to wash the entire unit by hand, which takes me 15-20 minutes.  When cleaning, it is important to clean the pump and ensure it is free from pet hair.  I even take a cotton swab to get into deep areas that are impossible otherwise to clean.This is a 5-star product for those who are good with keeping up on regular maintenance.  For those who are not good about maintenance, I would pass on this for daily use, but still look into it as something to use when leaving your pet alone for a few days. I own the jumbo size and that can store water for up to 2 weeks for my single cat.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Product With Proper Maintenance", "unixReviewTime": 1262649600, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2010"}

I introduced it to her at 3 years old after using a bowl her whole life and it took a while for her to get use to, but she loves it now. The fountain worked great for a while....but after a couple of weeks it started becoming very noisy. This fountain is very picky. If any little thing is bothering it, it makes a tremendous amount of sound and it is a pain to figure out what exactly is bothering it. So this kind of defeats the purpose of it being a self-cleaning fountain. It also does not recycle the water very well. The water still gets very dirty and I see pieces all the time that don't go through the filter.

My 1st one was the blue (discontinued color) medium size 50 oz.  It worked wonderfully.  It was quiet, unless it needed to be refilled.  It never leaked and my cat preferred it over the bowl.  She would always drink out of the running faucet.  I had to fill it every week or so.  The pump died twice, might have been my fault for not refilling the bowl as fast as I should of.  Overall I was very happy with it.  It lasted a year.  My only complaint was that there'd be a sludge, or slime that would occur.  Maybe from not cleaning it more often?  Also a lime build up (I think thats what it's called) where this dry white stuff would occur on parts of it.  People say you can clean it w/ vinegar, I tried but it wasn't a huge success it doesn't completely get rid of it and it comes back.So 2 weeks ago I needed a new pump and since the plastic was all nasty from the dryness on it, I splurged and got another.  Plus I got a new kitten on top of it.  I got the cream color medium size again.  Now with two cats I was filling it up daily, and it leaked every time it was filled.  Since I was returning it for faultiness.  I ended up looking around for a larger size.I found this one, cream color 108 oz large size.  I wanted to get the jumbo, just to not have to fill it that often, but I figure that would've been more for a small dog instead.  Overall I'm very happy with the size I got, it's twice the size of my old one and I've notice no problems.  I suspect it will have the same issues, but overall I'd rather have it then a bowl.  Just a note, try and not keep the food bowl next to it too close.  If you're like my cats and they spill into the bowl and then it just makes you clean it more.I wish that they would make an all stainless steal model.

I liked Felidae because it wasn't too expensive and seems to have excellent ingredients. I would have gone with the grain free option except for the cost. I went to a local pet food supplier to pick up a can of this before I bought a whole case (after reading reviews that some cats won't eat it) and luckily both of mine LOVED it. My male cat has had problems with urinary issues in the past and I wanted to get him off prescription food onto something better so both my cats now get Wysong Uretic dry food in the morning (because I am still paranoid about the struvite crystals my cat had) and Felidae at night. I also plan on switching every other case with Nature's Variety because that is also an excellent food that my cats love. Glad to find a good canned food at an economical price!I originally wrote this review in December. It is now the end of February, and both of my cats are refusing to eat the Felidae food. Luckily I only have 3 cans left from the case I bought, but 2 cans have completely gone to waste. Not sure why my cats suddenly won't eat it, the food looks the same and smells the same as the previous cans from the case. The only thing I can think of is the Nature's Variety food that I am also feeding them is better and they prefer that so they are refusing to eat the Felidae. I have since switched my cats onto all canned food, so it is possible that they only like this when it is offered every once in a while compared to every day or two. I still like the food for the price and ingredients, but unfortunately I won't be buying any more.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "My cats loved it, but now won't eat it!", "unixReviewTime": 1324425600, "reviewTime": "12 21, 2011"}

It's amazing how many super premium brands have that ingredient prominently featured, which means I can't use them.

It did come with a fleece cover, which I always leave on, but I still put it under some fleece wrap and my cat LOVES it.  She always sleeps on it at night.  During the day, if I remember, I will put it under a blanket on the couch and she and another cat will sleep on it.  I tried it with my dog, but he wasn't interested.  I purchased a second one and have to admit that I stick it in bed with me.  I often have to fight my daughter for it.  Makes the sheets nice and warm.Now, if it isn't put under some type of cover, besides its fleece covering, it will cool much faster.  And many times I have taken it out of the microwave and thought, this isn't hot, but as I've had it in my bed with me, it can get painfully hot, so even if you think it isn't warm, it is still giving off a lot of heat.I can't be 100% sure, but I would think a lot of the negative comments are people who didn't have it heated right, knowing the wattage of your microwave is important, and not having it covered to retain the heat longer.I want to get a third one, but winter is pretty much over, so I'll wait till  fall again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "LOVE THIS item, wish I had it earlier", "unixReviewTime": 1239667200, "reviewTime": "04 14, 2009"}

Every winter night, I heat up a pad for 6 minutes in the microwave and then exchange it for the now-cold pad in the window well that I put there the night before. Very quick and simple. The pad does not get soft, but it definitely gets very warm. Do not handle the heated pad with your bare hands; use a towel or the cover that comes with it. Never place it where the cat would be laying with the hot pad up against his skin; always separate the pad from the cat with one or more blankets.

The blue plush covers I bought don't fit well and in fact tore when I tried to put them over the heating pads. Some things to keep in mind when you purchase one of these:These are HARD. So it's best if you forego the covers altogether, and simply place them under a few layers of blankets, or like I did- in a bed that is two parts; the bottom part that sits on the floor, the second part is a pillow that fits securely into the bed. I put the snugglesafe between the pillow and the bottom of the bed, without the cover so it releases more heat up into the pillow they lay on. Because these are HARD, some animals will get freaked out by them, because it's obvious that something is there, as in the review that told about the barn cat who wouldn't go near it. You need to do as I said above, put it under several layers of bedding so they don't know it's there, or purchase a two-part bed that leaves the heat pad safely (and discreetly) out of their area.These get VERY HOT. You need to make sure there are layers of protection between your pet and the snugglesafe. (Again, as described above.)

Winters can be cold in Tennessee, even though this is a Maine Coon with lots of long fur. He has a styrofoam house lined with straw which will keep him warm and he currently uses it when the temperatures drop into the 50's. I wanted added warmth for him on those colder nights and thought this was a great item. I've heated the disk once just to see how long it remained warm. After heating, it's just slightly warm to the touch with the cover on. I sat it on my coffee table and seven hours later, only the center of the disk remained warm. 30 minutes later, it was completely cool. Whether it retains the heat longer if the cat is actually laying on it, I don't know yet. The cover that comes with the disk is very soft. The extra blue cover is soft, but smaller and it barely fits the disk. You will have to fight with it to get the disk inside and the cover does not completely close in the back. I do plan to order another SnuggleSafe so I can alternate them when the temperature drops close to freezing. So far, for the money, I'm very pleased with the SnuggleSafe.This is an update. I've now used it with the cat. It stays warm for well over 11 hours. I put it in a zip-lock bag to slip under the straw bedding (the straw will stick to the fleece cover like velcro. It's so much easier to clean the straw off of the bag--I learned the hard way by just placing the SnuggleSafe under the straw). My second SnuggleSafe arrived.

Cats, as obligate carnivores, don't need grain, and in fact--if you give them something with a lot of carbs, they will continue eating until they have enough protein.Since I switched my cats a few years back to this brand, both lost weight even though I feed them as much of this as they will eat. It completely transformed one of my cats. He was dumpy, overweight and middle-aged and since the food transition he lost weight and has become more active. His fur looks amazing! I also recommended this food to a friend, forgot I made the recommendation and six months later was over his house and said, wow, your cat looks amazing! He said, yeah, it's the food change we talked about.That said, the Wellness line is not my cat's favorite by any means. The reason is that it's like switching a person from potato chips and McDonald's to good healthy food. The supermarket brands such as Fancy Feast are filled with rendered fat, which smells great and makes cats go crazy. This has none of this, so they miss it. I transitioned VERY slowly, mixing the food they liked with a small amount of this and gradually increasing the proportion over months.Now, years later, my cat eats this with gusto--though, of course, if I brought Fancy Feast back he would go nuts again for that, but I don't. This is is his second favorite flavor after this one:Wellness Canned Cat Food, Chicken and Herring Recipe, 12-Pack of 12-1/2-Ounce Cans.The nice thing about this food is that, while he now eats it with apparent pleasure, my cat never overeats. I can give him as much as he wants/asks for and he stays the same weight. I'd say he eats an average of a half 12-ounce can a day, but it varies--some days he eats almost a full can, other days less than half. So essentially he self regulates, whereas with the kitty crack and dried food, full of grain, he overate.These large cans must be opened with a can opener. I buy them because they are a better value economically--the small cans of this brand are way expensive. Even this is expensive per ounce,, but if you actually do a calculation of dollars paid per protein this one stacks up just fine to the less expensive brands.

Sure enough, an hour after getting it all scrubbed off, he was still very weak and tired but no longer vomiting or shaking.  I called my vet today to let them know that he was okay. I'm not bothering with Merial. I cannot understand why they would sell a product and advertise vet techs on staff and then have absolutely no recourse or help when a negative side effect occurs.  Amazon was much better to deal with for this issue. They allowed me to send the product back for a refund even though it had been opened. I'm glad that they stand by the items they sell.  I'm going to stick with eucalyptus oil and tea tree oil for my dog.

It works as advertised, and it is a must for dogs with an undercoat, such as a Golden Retriever, as their coat is simply too thick to police their skin 100% for ticks and fleas.  I'm not saying don't check them!  You absolutely must check over your pup for fleas and ticks, but Frontline gives you some extra protection.It is easy to administer, simply cut open the packet, spread your dog's fur on their back between their shoulder blades to get to the skinline, and then squeeze out the solution on to one spot on their skin.  Once a month is all it takes.An important note:  If you are buying this product for the first time, please understand that when the makers and retailers advertise that it provides flea protection for up to three months, they mean by using three doses, one per month, not 3 months of protection for each dose.My main reason for writing this review is to mention how yet again Amazon manages to offer superior pricing on a product.  Their prices for Frontline products is always a little less than other on-line retailers, and they blow pet stores out of the water, with prices about 30% less.

The delivery is always on time, the item is well packaged and the price is great. I like the big protection that it offers against parasites and it is very easy to apply monthly thanks to the pipes. I brought my dogs on hikings, at the park, in open fields and this Frontline Plus seems to work (i always check my dogs anyway). Just follow carefully the instructions in the package and you will do a perfect job. Of course i always avoid to bath my pet for 48 hours after i apply the product and be carefull to check your dogs for some hours, you want to notice if there is any change on the behaviour or they show any symphtom. I have been lucky and they always have been ok. Wash your hands well especially the first days after you pet your dog, it's always a bunch of chemicals that you don't want to ingest. Will purchase it again and again, maybe on the 6 months package now.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It works so far", "unixReviewTime": 1402099200, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2014"}

Sure, you will see other brands that cost much less than 'Frontline', but you get what you pay for.
