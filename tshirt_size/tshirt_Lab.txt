Use the size chart: Use a size chart that specifies the limits for shoulder breadth and chest circumference for each size.
 
Create a function: Write a function that iterates through each person's measurements and compares them with the size chart.
 
Count matches and conflicts: The function should count the number of individuals who have exactly one matching size and the number of individuals who have multiple possible sizes (conflicts).
 
Test your function with both female and male datasets, and use appropriate size charts for each gender.


Analyze the data: Use the new size charts to determine the number of matches and ties based on two measurements.

Count matches and ties: Write a function that iterates through each person's measurements, compares them with the new size charts, and counts the number of matches and ties.

Bonus:
Modify the function to handle ties. If there is a tie and the sizes are adjacent, choose the larger size to increase the number of matches.
