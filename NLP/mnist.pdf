Prediction Generation:
  1. How can you generate predictions from a trained neural network model using a test dataset? What function or method would you use?

Accessing Prediction Details:
  2. How would you access the prediction details for the second image in the test dataset? Which index would you use to retrieve this information from the predictions array?

Finding the Predicted Class:
  3. How can you determine the predicted class from the output of a neural network? What function would you use to find the index of the highest probability?

Visualizing Test Data:
  4. Which function would you use to visualize a specific test image, and what parameters might you need to provide to display it in grayscale?

Comparing with Actual Labels:
  5. How would you retrieve the actual label for the second image in the test dataset? Which index should you use to access this information?

Converting Predictions to Class Labels:
  6. How can you convert a list of prediction probabilities into class labels for each test image? What Python technique or method would help you iterate over the predictions and extract the labels?

Examining Initial Predictions:
  7. How would you access the first five predicted class labels from your converted predictions? Which part of the list would you slice to get this subset?
